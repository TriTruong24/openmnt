Now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
It &apos;s going to be a springboard for our global campaigning .
And the techies among you , you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be .
Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue .
The U.K. government is already on board ; it supports these public registries .
And just last week , the European Parliament came on board with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries .
That is momentum .
But it &apos;s early days .
America still needs to come on board , as do so many other countries .
And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians , because without that , real far-reaching , world-shifting change just isn &apos;t going to happen .
Because this isn &apos;t just about changing the law , this is about starting a conversation about what it &apos;s okay for companies to do , and in what ways is it acceptable to use company structures .
This isn &apos;t just a dry policy issue .
This is a human issue which affects us all .
This is about being on the right side of history .
Global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
Together , let &apos;s kickstart this global movement .
Let &apos;s just do it , let &apos;s end anonymous companies .
Thank you .

Chris Hadfield : What I learned from going blind in space
There &apos;s an astronaut saying : In space , &quot; there is no problem so bad that you can &apos;t make it worse . &quot; So how do you deal with the complexity , the sheer pressure , of dealing with dangerous and scary situations ? Retired colonel Chris Hadfield paints a vivid portrait of how to be prepared for the worst in space -- and it starts with walking into a spider &apos;s web . Watch for a special space-y performance .
What &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
Or another way to say it is , what &apos;s the most dangerous thing that you &apos;ve ever done ?
And why did you do it ?
I know what the most dangerous thing is that I &apos;ve ever done because NASA does the math .
You look back to the first five shuttle launches , the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine .
And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 , one in 40 .
Not great odds , so it &apos;s a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you &apos;re going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you &apos;re either going to be floating effortlessly , gloriously in space , or you &apos;ll be dead .
You go into , at the Kennedy Space Center , the suit-up room , the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in , that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon .
And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad , and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center , it &apos;s normally predawn , and in the distance , lit up by the huge xenon lights , is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet .
The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed , almost holding hands , looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger .
We ride the elevator up and we crawl in , on your hands and knees into the spaceship , one at a time , and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back .
And the hatch is closed , and suddenly , what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real , something that I dreamed about , in fact , that I chose to do when I was nine years old , is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening .
In the astronaut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle ; it &apos;s the most complicated flying machine ever built .
And in the astronaut business , we have a saying , which is , there is no problem so bad that you can &apos;t make it worse .
And so you &apos;re very conscious in the cockpit ; you &apos;re thinking about all of the things that you might have to do , all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through .
And as the time gets closer and closer , this excitement is building .
And then about three and a half minutes before launch , the huge nozzles on the back , like the size of big church bells , swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle , like the vehicle is alive underneath you , like an elephant getting up off its knees or something .
And then about 30 seconds before launch , the vehicle is completely alive -- it is ready to go -- the APUs are running , the computers are all self-contained , it &apos;s ready to leave the planet .
And 15 seconds before launch , this happens : Voice : 12 , 11 , 10 , nine , eight , seven , six -- -- start , two , one , booster ignition , and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery , returning to the space station , paving the way ...
Chris Hadfield : It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things .
You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself .
It &apos;s shaking you so hard you can &apos;t focus on the instruments in front of you .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re in the jaws of some enormous dog and there &apos;s a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space , accelerating wildly straight up , shouldering your way through the air , and you &apos;re in a very complex place -- paying attention , watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face .
After two minutes , those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines , the hydrogen and oxygen , and it &apos;s as if you &apos;re in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you &apos;ve never accelerated .
You get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
It feels like someone &apos;s pouring cement on you or something .
Until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we &apos;re weightless .
And we &apos;re alive .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
But why would we take that risk ?
Why would you do something that dangerous ?
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward .
I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do .
I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me , it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that .
But the real question is , how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it ?
How do you deal with fear versus danger ?
And having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second , around the world 16 times a day , with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside .
But maybe even more importantly , allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means , to be able to look down and have -- if your jaw could drop , it would -- the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic , constantly changing beauty that is the world itself .
And you see , because of the speed , a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year .
And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk .
You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit , and you &apos;re going through space with the world .
It &apos;s an entirely different perspective , you &apos;re not looking up at the universe , you and the Earth are going through the universe together .
And you &apos;re holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
It &apos;s roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you .
And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything , it &apos;s unfathomable blackness , with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into .
and you are holding on with one hand , one link to the other seven billion people .
And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind , and I didn &apos;t know why .
Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn &apos;t figure out why my eye wasn &apos;t working .
I was thinking , what do I do next ?
I thought , well maybe that &apos;s why we have two eyes , so I kept working .
But unfortunately , without gravity , tears don &apos;t fall .
So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually , the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes &quot; goosh &quot; into your other eye , and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship .
So what &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
I think you should be afraid of spiders -- spiders are creepy and they &apos;ve got long , hairy legs , and spiders like this one , the brown recluse -- it &apos;s horrible . If a brown recluse bites you , you end with one of these horrible , big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you , in fact .
And how do you know ?
And so a spider lands on you , and you go through this great , spasmy attack because spiders are scary .
But then you could say , well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not ?
I don &apos;t know . Are there brown recluses here ?
So if you actually do the research , you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders , and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000 .
And if you &apos;re in Canada , because of the cold winters here in B.C. , there &apos;s about 720 , 730 different types of spiders and there &apos;s one -- one -- that is venomous , and its venom isn &apos;t even fatal , it &apos;s just kind of like a nasty sting .
And that spider -- not only that , but that spider has beautiful markings on it , it &apos;s like &quot; I &apos;m dangerous . I got a big radiation symbol on my back , it &apos;s the black widow . &quot;
So , if you &apos;re even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider -- and it lives close the ground , you &apos;re walking along , you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you .
Spider webs like this , it doesn &apos;t build those , it builds them down in the corners .
And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male ; it doesn &apos;t care about you .
So in fact , the next time you walk into a spiderweb , you don &apos;t need to panic and go with your caveman reaction .
The danger is entirely different than the fear .
How do you get around it , though ?
How do you change your behavior ?
Well , next time you see a spiderweb , have a good look , make sure it &apos;s not a black widow spider , and then walk into it .
And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one .
It &apos;s just a little bit of fluffy stuff . It &apos;s not a big deal .
And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly .
And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior , your caveman reaction , and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb -- or into your grandma &apos;s attic or whatever , into your own basement .
And you can apply this to anything .
If you &apos;re outside on a spacewalk and you &apos;re blinded , your natural reaction would be to panic , I think .
It would make you nervous and worried .
But we had considered all the venom , and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs .
We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
And we don &apos;t just practice things going right , we practice things going wrong all the time , so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs .
And not just underwater , but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it &apos;s realistic .
So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
And even if you &apos;re blinded , your natural , panicky reaction doesn &apos;t happen .
Instead you kind of look around and go , &quot; Okay , I can &apos;t see , but I can hear , I can talk , Scott Parazynski is out here with me .
He could come over and help me . &quot;
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue , so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to .
I could find my own way back .
It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
And actually , if you keep on crying for a while , whatever that gunk was that &apos;s in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again , and Houston , if you negotiate with them , they will let you then keep working .
We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside , Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes , and it turned out it was just the anti-fog , sort of a mixture of oil and soap , that got in my eye .
And now we use Johnson &apos;s No More Tears , which we probably should &apos;ve been using right from the very beginning . But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger , where is the real risk ?
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening .
You can fundamentally change your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...
where you could see the hardpan south of the Sahara , or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike , or the unconscious gingham of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles .
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge , just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear .
You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened .
It &apos;s time to come home at the end .
This is our spaceship , the Soyuz , that little one .
Three of us climb in , and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere .
These two parts here actually melt , we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere .
The only part that survives is the little bullet that we &apos;re riding in , and it falls into the atmosphere , and in essence you are riding a meteorite home , and riding meteorites is scary , and it ought to be .
But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming , like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth -- -- instead , 20 years previously we had started studying Russian , and then once you learn Russian , then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian , and then we learned vehicle control theory , and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again .
And in fact , you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth .
So in fact , when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz , we weren &apos;t screaming , we were laughing ; it was fun .
And when the great big parachute opened , we knew that if it didn &apos;t open there &apos;s a second parachute , and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism .
So we came back , we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz , in Kazakhstan .
Reporter : And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters , once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters .
Touchdown -- 3 : 14 and 48 seconds , a.m. Central Time .
CH : And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end , but you &apos;re ready for it you &apos;re in a custom-built seat , you know how the shock absorber works .
And then eventually the Russians reach in , drag you out , plunk you into a chair , and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience .
You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy , which were impossible and dauntingly scary , dauntingly terrifying , and put them into practice , and figured out a way to reprogram yourself , to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise .
Just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
I know this song , and it &apos;s really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself , but it &apos;s also , I think , a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe , we are people , and we &apos;re taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place .
This is Major Tom to ground control I &apos;ve left forevermore And I &apos;m floating in a most peculiar way And the stars look very different today For here am I floating in the tin can A last glimpse of the world Planet Earth is blue and there &apos;s so much left to do Fear not .
That &apos;s very nice of you . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Carin Bondar : The birds and the bees are just the beginning
Think you know a thing or two about sex ? Think again . In this fascinating talk , biologist Carin Bondar lays out the surprising science behind how animals get it on .
Anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
Yeah , you did .
Thank you for putting your hand up over there .
Well , I &apos;m here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams .
I &apos;m here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex .
Now , when humans think about sex , male and female forms are generally what come to mind , but for many millions of years , such specific categories didn &apos;t even exist .
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings .
It wasn &apos;t until about 500 million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out , and a vagina , something that receives it .
Now invariably , you &apos;re probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
Penile diversity is especially profuse .
So this is a paper nautilus .
It &apos;s a close relative of squid and octopus , and males have a hectocotylus .
Just what is a hectocotylus ?
A detachable , swimming penis .
It leaves the &#91; body of the male &#93; , finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water , attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm .
For many decades , biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether .
Now , the tapir is a mammal from South America .
And the tapir has a prehensile penis .
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female &apos;s uterus , not to mention it &apos;s a pretty good size .
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom , however , is not that of the tapir .
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle , and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle .
Mm-hm . So with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
Simply insert part A into slot B , and we should all be good to go .
But of course , that doesn &apos;t exactly happen , and that &apos;s because we can &apos;t just take form into account .
We have to think about function as well , and when it comes to sex , function relates to the contributions made by the gametes , or the sperm and the eggs .
And these contributions are far from equal .
Eggs are very expensive to make , so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with .
Sperm , on the other hand , is abundant and cheap , so it makes more sense for males to have a more-sex-is-better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations .
So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes ?
I mean , if a female doesn &apos;t choose a particular male , or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough , then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things : avoiding predators , taking care of offspring , gathering and ingesting food .
This is , of course , bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank , and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization .
This is bedbug sex , and it &apos;s aptly termed traumatic insemination .
Males have a spiked , barbed penis that they literally stab into the female , and they don &apos;t stab it anywhere near her vagina .
They stab it anywhere in her body , and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries .
If a female gets too many stab wounds , or if a stab wound happens to become infected , she can actually die from it .
Now if you &apos;ve ever been out for a nice , peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex , you &apos;ve undoubtedly been alarmed , because it looks like gang rape .
And quite frankly , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
A group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again .
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second .
Now the female actually gets the last laugh , though , because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries .
Now , I like to share stories like this with my audiences because , yeah , we humans , we tend to think sex , sex is fun , sex is good , there &apos;s romance , and there &apos;s orgasm .
But orgasm didn &apos;t actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals .
But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that .
There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one &apos;s partner .
Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones .
It &apos;s a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different .
Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all .
So going back to our biological minds , then , we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages , because she can use her time for other things : avoiding predators , taking care of young , finding and ingesting food .
But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages .
Why do they do this ?
Well , according to the biological literature , &quot; During copulation , the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract . &quot;
Mm-hm .
These are Mexican guppies , and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments , and these filaments basically form a fish mustache , if you will .
Now males have been observed to prod the female &apos;s genital opening prior to copulating with her , and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum , P.I. hypothesis , females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches .
A little guppy porn for you right there .
So we &apos;ve seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner .
We &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
We &apos;ve also seen a titillation strategy pleasing their female partners into choosing them Now unfortunately , in the animal kingdom , it &apos;s the coercion strategy that we see time and time again .
It &apos;s very common in many phyla , from invertebrates to avian species , mammals , and , of course , even in primates .
Now interestingly , there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn &apos;t allow for sexual coercion to take place .
Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris , or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally , much like a penis , and in fact it &apos;s very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology .
So before a male can insert his penis into a female &apos;s vagina , she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside-out it in her own body .
I mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
It &apos;s simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action .
Now , even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal : they &apos;re run by females , groups of females , sisters , aunts and offspring , and when young males attain sexual maturity , they &apos;re turfed out of the group .
In hyena societies , adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale .
They can take part in a kill only after everybody else , including the offspring .
So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male , you take away all the social power he has .
So what are my take-home messages from my talk today ?
Well , sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere .
The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other , which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve .
So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals , including ourselves , spend a good amount of time thinking about sex , but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it .
So thank you , and happy daydreaming .

Anne-Marie Slaughter : Can we all &quot; have it all &quot; ?
Public policy expert Anne-Marie Slaughter made waves with her 2012 article , &quot; Why women still can &apos;t have it all . &quot; But really , is this only a question for women ? Here Slaughter expands her ideas and explains why shifts in work culture , public policy and social mores can lead to more equality -- for men , women , all of us .
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
In 2010 , I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department .
This was my moment to lean in , to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs , and I had just finished a big , 18-month project for Secretary Clinton , successfully , and I knew I could handle a bigger job .
The woman I thought I was would have said yes .
But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton , New Jersey , where my husband and my two teenage sons lived , and it was not going well .
I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington , or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me .
But deep down , I knew that the right decision was to go home , even if I didn &apos;t fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
That was a decision based on love and responsibility .
I couldn &apos;t keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me .
But the real change came more gradually .
Over the next year , while my family was righting itself , I started to realize that even if I could go back into government , I didn &apos;t want to .
I didn &apos;t want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home .
I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me , not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want , and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed .
I am still completely committed to the cause of male-female equality , but let &apos;s think about what that equality really means , and how best to achieve it .
I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers , so that the measure of male-female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions : prime ministers , presidents , CEOs , directors , managers , Nobel laureates , leaders .
I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
But that &apos;s only half of real equality , and I now think we &apos;re never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
I suggest that real equality , full equality , does not just mean valuing women on male terms .
It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men .
And to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
In the workplace , real equality means valuing family just as much as work , and understanding that the two reinforce each other .
As a leader and as a manager , I have always acted on the mantra , if family comes first , work does not come second -- life comes together .
If you work for me , and you have a family issue , I expect you to attend to it , and I am confident , and my confidence has always been borne out , that the work will get done , and done better .
Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused , more efficient , more results-focused .
And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts .
Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents .
He &apos;s much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
And caregiving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and empathy , creativity , resilience , adaptability .
Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high-speed , horizontal , networked global economy .
The best companies actually know this .
The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations , and a 2008 national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work , they &apos;re more satisfied and more loyal , they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health .
And a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy .
So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem .
Sadly , though , the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease .
Twenty years ago , when my family first started going to Italy , we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta .
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day .
It &apos;s actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch .
Now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24-hour competition .
So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative .
In policy terms , real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done , no matter who does it .
Think about it : Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival .
At least if we get beyond a barter economy , somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones .
Now most of you , when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving , instinctively translate those categories into men &apos;s work and women &apos;s work .
And we don &apos;t typically challenge why men &apos;s work is advantaged .
But consider a same-sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily .
They &apos;re psychiatrists .
They got married five years ago , and now they have two-year-old twins .
They love being mothers , but they also love their work , and they &apos;re really good at what they do .
So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules ?
And what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career ?
Or who has the most flexible boss ?
The same-sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women &apos;s problems , they &apos;re family problems .
And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones , because they have a choice about how much they want to work .
Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need , and many of those workers are scrambling .
They &apos;re patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe .
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal , then why shouldn &apos;t a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy ?
The governments that get it -- no surprises here -- the governments that get it , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , the Netherlands , provide universal child care , support for caregivers at home , school and early childhood education , protections for pregnant women , and care for the elderly and the disabled .
Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains .
Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other .
They routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies , but at the same time , they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index .
In fact , they rank higher than other governments , like my own , the U.S. , or Switzerland , that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work-life balance .
So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference , but we &apos;re not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture , and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men .
Increasingly in developed countries , women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home , but men are actually still where they always were .
Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
It &apos;s certainly not complete .
But 60 years after &quot; The Feminine Mystique &quot; was published , many women actually have more choices than men do .
We can decide to be a breadwinner , a caregiver , or any combination of the two .
When a man , on the other hand , decides to be a caregiver , he puts his manhood on the line .
His friends may praise his decision , but underneath , they &apos;re scratching their heads .
Isn &apos;t the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige ?
And as many women hold that view as men do .
We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career .
A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner .
For a man , that &apos;s a risky proposition .
So as parents and partners , we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be , either caregivers or breadwinners .
We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys .
I can almost hear lots of you thinking , &quot; No way . &quot;
But in fact , the change is actually already happening .
At least in the United States , lots of men take pride in cooking , and frankly obsess over stoves .
They are in the birthing rooms .
They take paternity leave when they can .
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can , and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework .
Indeed , there are male college students now who are starting to say , &quot; I want to be a stay-at-home dad . &quot;
That was completely unthinkable 50 or even 30 years ago .
And in Norway , where men have an automatic three month &apos;s paternity leave , but they lose it if they decide not to take it , a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn &apos;t in fact take their leave when they had kids .
That means that it &apos;s starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father .
So I was raised to believe that championing women &apos;s rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top .
And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force .
But I &apos;ve come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work , and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do .
Thirty years ago , Carol Gilligan , a wonderful psychologist , studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care , an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice .
It turns out that &quot; you don &apos;t care &quot; is just as much a part of who we are as &quot; that &apos;s not fair . &quot;
Bill Gates agrees .
He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others .
Let &apos;s bring them both together .
Let &apos;s make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution .
As whole human beings , we will be better caregivers and breadwinners .
You may think that can &apos;t happen , but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties , where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms , and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual .
Today , not so much .
The revolution for human equality can happen .
It is happening .
It will happen .
How far and how fast is up to us .
Thank you .

Ajit Narayanan : A word game to communicate in any language
While working with kids who have trouble speaking , Ajit Narayanan sketched out a way to think about language in pictures , to relate words and concepts in &quot; maps . &quot; The idea now powers an app that helps nonverbal people communicate , and the big idea behind it , a language concept called FreeSpeech , has exciting potential .
I work with children with autism .
Specifically , I make technologies to help them communicate .
Now , many of the problems that children with autism face , they have a common source , and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction , symbolism .
And because of this , they have a lot of difficulty with language .
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup .
All of us can see it . All of us understand this .
These are two other pictures of soup , but you can see that these are more abstract And when you get to language , you see that it becomes a word whose look , the way it looks and the way it sounds , has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with , or what it represents , which is the bowl of soup .
So it &apos;s essentially a completely abstract , a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world , and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with .
Now that &apos;s why most of the people that work with children with autism -- speech therapists , educators -- what they do is , they try to help children with autism communicate not with words , but with pictures .
So if a child with autism wanted to say , &quot; I want soup , &quot; that child would pick three different pictures , &quot; I , &quot; &quot; want , &quot; and &quot; soup , &quot; and they would put these together , and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say .
And this has been incredibly effective ; for the last 30 , 40 years people have been doing this .
In fact , a few years back , I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this . It &apos;s called Avaz , and the way it works is that kids select different pictures .
These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences , and these sentences are spoken out .
So Avaz is essentially converting pictures , it &apos;s a translator , it converts pictures into speech .
Now , this was very effective .
There are thousands of children using this , you know , all over the world , and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn &apos;t do .
And I realized something interesting : Avaz helps children with autism learn words .
What it doesn &apos;t help them do is to learn word patterns .
Let me explain this in a little more detail .
Take this sentence : &quot; I want soup tonight . &quot;
Now it &apos;s not just the words here that convey the meaning .
It &apos;s also the way in which these words are arranged , the way these words are modified and arranged .
And that &apos;s why a sentence like &quot; I want soup tonight &quot; is different from a sentence like &quot; Soup want I tonight , &quot; which is completely meaningless .
So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with , and that &apos;s the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings , to convey different ideas .
Now , this is what we call grammar .
And grammar is incredibly powerful , because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information , an infinite amount of ideas .
in order to convey anything you want to .
And so after I developed Avaz , I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar to children with autism .
The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom , Completely out of the blue , very spontaneously , the child got up and said , &quot; Eat . &quot;
Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
So she asked , &quot; Eat what ? Do you want to eat ice cream ?
You want to eat ? Somebody else wants to eat ?
You want to eat cream now ? You want to eat ice cream in the evening ? &quot;
And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible .
She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar .
And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
Instead of arranging words in an order , in sequence , as a sentence , you arrange them in this map , where they &apos;re all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions , in question-answer pairs .
And so if you do this , then what you &apos;re conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you &apos;re conveying is really a meaning , Now , meaning is really the underbelly , in some sense , of language .
It &apos;s what comes after thought but before language .
And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form .
So I was very excited by this , you know , hopping around all over the place , trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this .
And I found that this is not enough .
Why is this not enough ?
something like negation , you want to say , &quot; I don &apos;t want soup , &quot; then you can &apos;t do that by asking a question .
You do that by changing the word &quot; want . &quot;
Again , if you wanted to say , &quot; I wanted soup yesterday , &quot; you do that by converting the word &quot; want &quot; into &quot; wanted . &quot;
It &apos;s a past tense .
So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete .
This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers , and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances .
Let me show you this with a different example . Let &apos;s take this sentence : &quot; I told the carpenter I could not pay him . &quot;
It &apos;s a fairly complicated sentence .
The way that this particular system works , you can start with any part of this sentence .
I &apos;m going to start with the word &quot; tell . &quot;
So this is the word &quot; tell . &quot;
Now this happened in the past , so I &apos;m going to make that &quot; told . &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask questions .
So , who told ? I told .
I told whom ? I told the carpenter .
Now we start with a different part of the sentence . We start with the word &quot; pay , &quot; and we add the ability filter to it to make it &quot; can pay . &quot;
Then we make it &quot; can &apos;t pay , &quot; and we can make it &quot; couldn &apos;t pay &quot; So who couldn &apos;t pay ? I couldn &apos;t pay .
Couldn &apos;t pay whom ? I couldn &apos;t pay the carpenter .
And then you join these two together by asking this question : What did I tell the carpenter ?
I told the carpenter I could not pay him .
Now think about this . This is — — this is a representation of this sentence without language .
And there are two or three interesting things about this .
First of all , I could have started anywhere .
I didn &apos;t have to start with the word &quot; tell . &quot;
I could have started anywhere in the sentence , The second thing is , if I wasn &apos;t an English speaker , if I was speaking in some other language , this map would actually hold true in any language .
So long as the questions are standardized , So I call this FreeSpeech , and I was playing with this for many , many months .
I was trying out so many different combinations of this .
And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech .
I was trying to convert language , convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech , and vice versa , and back and forth .
And I realized that this particular configuration , this particular way of representing language , it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other .
So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English .
I developed this thing called the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text .
And by putting these two pieces together , the representation and the engine , I was able to create an app , a technology for children with autism , that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar .
So I tried this out with kids with autism , and I found that there was an incredible amount of identification . They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English , and I started thinking about why that might be the case .
And I had an idea , and I want to talk to you about this idea next . In about 1997 , about 15 years back , there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language , and they found something very interesting .
They found that when you learn a language as a child , as a two-year-old , you learn it with a certain part of your brain , and when you learn a language as an adult -- for example , if I wanted to learn Japanese right now — a completely different part of my brain is used .
Now I don &apos;t know why that &apos;s the case , but my guess is that that &apos;s because when you learn a language as an adult , you almost invariably learn it through your native language , or through your first language .
So what &apos;s interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language , a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech , they &apos;re not using this support language , they &apos;re not using this bridge language . They &apos;re directly constructing the sentence .
And so this gave me this idea .
Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities ?
And so I tried a number of experiments .
The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes , in the form of colors , and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works .
And I built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they &apos;re able to learn language .
And this , this has a lot of potential , a lot of promise , and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us , and they &apos;re going to try it out with millions of different children And the dream , the hope , the vision , really , is that when they learn English this way , they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue .
All right , let &apos;s talk about something else .
Let &apos;s talk about speech .
So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us .
Now what &apos;s interesting about speech is that speech is one-dimensional .
Why is it one-dimensional ? It &apos;s one-dimensional because it &apos;s sound .
It &apos;s also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
But if you think about the brain , the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one-dimensional .
I mean , we have these rich , complicated , multi-dimensional ideas .
Now , it seems to me that language is really the brain &apos;s invention to convert this rich , multi-dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand .
Now what &apos;s interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
Take Google , for example .
Google trawls all these countless billions of websites , all of which are in English , and when you want to use Google , you go into Google search , and you type in English , and it matches the English with the English .
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead ?
I have a suspicion that if we did this , we &apos;d find that algorithms like searching , like retrieval , all of these things , are much simpler and also more effective , because they don &apos;t process the data structure of speech .
Instead they &apos;re processing the data structure of thought .
The data structure of thought .
That &apos;s a provocative idea .
But let &apos;s look at this in a little more detail .
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem .
We have the Free Speech representation on one side , and we have the FreeSpeech Engine , which generates English .
FreeSpeech , I told you , is completely language-independent .
It doesn &apos;t have any specific information in it which is about English .
So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine .
That &apos;s a pretty interesting concept in itself .
You &apos;ve encoded an entire human language into a software program .
it &apos;s actually not very complicated .
And what &apos;s more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English-specific .
And that gives this interesting idea .
It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many , many different languages , in Hindi , in French , in German , in Swahili .
And that gives another interesting idea .
For example , supposing I was a writer , say , for a newspaper or for a magazine .
I could create content in one language , FreeSpeech , and the person who &apos;s consuming that content , the person who &apos;s reading that particular information could choose any engine , and they could read it in their own mother tongue , in their native language .
I mean , this is an incredibly attractive idea , especially for India .
We have so many different languages .
There &apos;s a song about India , and there &apos;s a description of the country as , it says , .
That means &quot; ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages . &quot;
Language is beautiful .
I think it &apos;s the most beautiful of human creations .
I think it &apos;s the loveliest thing that our brains have invented .
It entertains , it educates , it enlightens , but what I like the most about language is that it empowers . I want to leave you with this .
This is a photograph of my collaborators , my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things .
The girl &apos;s name is Pavna , and that &apos;s her mother , Kalpana .
And Pavna &apos;s an entrepreneur , but her story is much more remarkable than mine , because Pavna is about 23 .
She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy , so ever since she was born , she could neither move nor talk .
And everything that she &apos;s accomplished so far , finishing school , going to college , starting a company , collaborating with me to develop Avaz , all of these things she &apos;s done with nothing more than moving her eyes .
Daniel Webster said this : He said , &quot; If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception , I would choose to keep the power of communication , for with it , I would regain all the rest . &quot;
And that &apos;s why , of all of these incredible applications of FreeSpeech , the one that &apos;s closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate , the power of communication , to get back all the rest .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Henry Lin : What we can learn from galaxies far , far away
In a fun , exciting talk , teenager Henry Lin looks at something unexpected in the sky : distant galaxy clusters . By studying the properties of the universe &apos;s largest pieces , says the Intel Science Fair award winner , we can learn quite a lot about scientific mysteries in our own world and galaxy .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas -- in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Third thing : probing the very small .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
You were lied to .
Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
Here is an image .
Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
He had this to say : &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot;
Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

Christopher Ryan : Are we designed to be sexual omnivores ?
An idea permeates our modern view of relationships : that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships . But before the dawn of agriculture , humans may actually have been quite promiscuous . Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature , in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination , shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships .
I &apos;m going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation .
All right . Are you with me ? Yeah . Yeah . All right .
So what I &apos;d like to do is have you raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex .
Could be the neighbors , hotel room , your parents . Sorry .
Okay . Pretty much everybody .
Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman .
I see one guy there .
It doesn &apos;t count if it was you , sir .
So his hand &apos;s down . And one woman . Okay .
Sitting next to a loud guy .
Now what does this tell us ?
It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex , and it &apos;s generally the woman who makes more noise .
This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd .
I wasn &apos;t even going to mention this , but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here , and she is the world &apos;s most famous female copulatory vocalizer .
So I thought , got to talk about that .
We &apos;ll get back to that a little bit later .
Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes , despite what you may have heard . We are apes .
We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant , as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
We &apos;re more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas , orangutans , what have you .
So we &apos;re extremely closely related to them , and as you &apos;ll see in terms of our behavior , we &apos;ve got some relationship as well .
So what I &apos;m asking today , the question I want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
Now , since Darwin &apos;s day there &apos;s been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution , and you &apos;re all familiar with it , even if you haven &apos;t read this stuff .
The idea is that , as part of human nature , from the beginning of our species &apos; time , men have sort of leased women &apos;s reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services .
Generally we &apos;re talking about meat , shelter , status , protection , things like that .
And in exchange , women have offered fidelity , or at least a promise of fidelity .
Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship .
The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA , according to this vision . Right ?
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no , this economic relationship , this oppositional relationship , is actually an artifact of agriculture , which only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest .
Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years , so we &apos;re talking about five percent , at most , of our time as a modern , distinct species .
So before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
They not only share things , they demand that things be shared : meat , shelter , protection , all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity , it turns out , are shared widely among these societies .
Now I &apos;m not saying that our ancestors were noble savages , and I &apos;m not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either .
What I &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
And there &apos;s really no argument about this among anthropologists .
All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality .
So we &apos;ve argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved , until agriculture , as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex , flexible social systems , networks , that our ancestors were very good at , and that &apos;s why our species has survived so well .
Now , this makes some people uncomfortable , and so I always need to take a moment in these talks to say , listen , I &apos;m saying our ancestors were promiscuous , but I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
There were no strangers . Right ?
In a hunter-gatherer band , there are no strangers .
So I &apos;m saying , yes , there were overlapping sexual relationships , that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives .
But I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
I &apos;m not saying that they didn &apos;t love the people they were having sex with .
And I &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
I &apos;m just saying it wasn &apos;t sexually exclusive .
And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous -- my parents , for example , have been married for 52 years monogamously , and if it wasn &apos;t monogamously , Mom and Dad , I don &apos;t want to hear about it — I &apos;m not criticizing this and I &apos;m not saying there &apos;s anything wrong with this .
What I &apos;m saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism .
You can choose to be a vegetarian , but don &apos;t think that just because you &apos;ve made that decision , bacon suddenly stops smelling good .
Okay ? So this is my point .
That one took a minute to sink in , huh ?
Now , in addition to being a great genius , a wonderful man , a wonderful husband , a wonderful father , Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude .
All right ? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates , including chimps and bonobos , because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females .
So he couldn &apos;t understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond , right ?
Chimps and bonobos , Darwin didn &apos;t really know this , but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings .
Interestingly , chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent , roughly , of their menstrual cycle , bonobos 90 percent , and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle , whether she &apos;s menstruating , whether she &apos;s post-menopausal , whether she &apos;s already pregnant .
This is vanishingly rare among mammals .
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
Now , Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day , as scientists tend to do sometimes .
So what we &apos;re talking about is sperm competition .
Now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells , so it &apos;s already a competitive environment .
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men &apos;s sperm or just their own .
There &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
The one thing I &apos;ll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human .
That indicates female copulatory vocalization .
Just look at the numbers .
The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth .
If that number seems high for some of you , I assure you it seems low for others in the room .
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos .
the gorilla , the orangutan and the gibbon , who are more typical of mammals , having sex only about a dozen times per birth .
Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive .
And you &apos;ll see that the human , chimp and bonobo all have external testicles , which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer .
If you &apos;re the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage , you expect a party to happen at any moment , and you need to be ready .
That &apos;s what the external testicles are .
They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
The human , some of you will be happy to hear , has the largest , thickest penis of any primate .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
It goes into anthropology as well .
Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution .
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China .
In their society , everyone , men and women , are completely sexually autonomous .
There &apos;s no shame associated with sexual behavior .
Women have hundreds of partners .
It doesn &apos;t matter . Nobody cares . Nobody gossips . It &apos;s not an issue .
When the woman becomes pregnant , the child is cared for by her , her sisters , and her brothers .
The biological father is a nonissue .
On the other side of the planet , in the Amazon , we &apos;ve got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity .
These people actually believe -- and they have no contact among them , no common language or anything , so it &apos;s not an idea that spread , it &apos;s an idea that &apos;s arisen around the world -- they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen .
So a woman who wants to have a child who &apos;s smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy , the funny guy and the strong guy , to get the essence of each of these men into the baby , and then when the child is born , these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child .
So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society .
So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book .
Now , why does this matter ?
Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation .
I think that &apos;s true . This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world .
The contradictions between what we &apos;re told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering .
My hope is that a more accurate , updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves , for each other , greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions , and that we &apos;ll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate , instinctive right to monitor and control women &apos;s sexual behavior .
Thank you .
And we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s not only gay people that have to come out of the closet .
We all have closets we have to come out of . Right ?
And when we do come out of those closets , we &apos;ll recognize that our fight is not with each other , our fight is with an outdated , Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights , generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy .
It &apos;s time we moved beyond Mars and Venus , because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa .
Thank you .
Thank you . Christopher Ryan : Thank you .
So a question .
It &apos;s so perplexing , trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today .
Someone could give a talk and say , look at us , we &apos;ve got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that &apos;s really good at throwing weapons , and if you look at lots of societies around the world , you &apos;ll see very high rates of violence .
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism , but it &apos;s not who you are .
How is that different from the talk you gave ?
CR : Well first of all , the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable .
But that &apos;s just an example .
Certainly , you know , lots of people say to me , just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn &apos;t mean we should live that way now , and I agree with that .
Everyone has to respond to the modern world .
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories .
And so you could live on McDonald &apos;s and milkshakes , but your body will rebel against that . We have appetites .
I think it was Schopenhauer who said , a person can do what they want but not want what they want .
And so what I &apos;m arguing against is the shame that &apos;s associated with desires .
It &apos;s the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people , there &apos;s something wrong with you , there &apos;s something wrong with your marriage , something wrong with your partner .
I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
Thank you . Communicated powerfully . Thanks a lot .
CR : Thank you , Chris .
Molly Stevens : A new way to grow bone
What does it take to regrow bone in mass quantities ? Typical bone regeneration -- wherein bone is taken from a patient &apos;s hip and grafted onto damaged bone elsewhere in the body -- is limited and can cause great pain just a few years after operation . In an informative talk , Molly Stevens introduces a new stem cell application that harnesses bone &apos;s innate ability to regenerate and produces vast quantities of bone tissue painlessly .
As humans , it &apos;s in our nature to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering .
Whatever life throws at us , whether it &apos;s cancer , diabetes , heart disease , or even broken bones , we want to try and get better .
Now I &apos;m head of a biomaterials lab , and I &apos;m really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time .
Take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
We &apos;re not quite sure why they did it .
It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s durable .
But it also had other very nice properties .
In fact , when they put it into the jawbone , it could integrate into the jaw , and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way , has a beautiful chemistry , has a beautiful architecture .
And I think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology .
But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different materials in the body , very often it &apos;s been physicians that have been quite creative .
They &apos;ve taken things off the shelf .
One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley , who was a famous ophthalmologist , or at least became a famous ophthalmologist .
And during World War II , what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions , and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye , but the very interesting thing about it was that material , actually , wasn &apos;t causing any inflammatory response .
So he looked into this , and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires .
And this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses .
It &apos;s called PMMA , and it &apos;s now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts .
And that example , I think , is a really nice one , because it helps remind us that in the early days , people often chose materials because they were bioinert .
Their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function .
You &apos;d put them in the body and you wouldn &apos;t get an adverse response .
And what I want to show you is that in regenerative medicine , we &apos;ve really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material .
We &apos;re actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive , that will interact with the body , and that furthermore we can put in the body , they &apos;ll have their function , and then they &apos;ll dissolve away over time .
If we look at this schematic , this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue-engineering approach .
We have cells there , typically from the patient .
We can put those onto a material , and we can make that material very complex if we want to , and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient .
And this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
But one of the things that &apos;s really important when we &apos;re thinking about stem cells is that obviously stem cells can be many different things , and they want to be many different things , and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue .
And if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world , in all the different labs in the world , there &apos;s pretty much every tissue you can think of .
And actually , the structure of those tissues is quite different , and it &apos;s going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease , other conditions , in terms of how you &apos;re going to regenerate your tissue , and you &apos;re going to need to think about the materials you &apos;re going to use really carefully , their biochemistry , their mechanics , and many other properties as well .
Our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate , and here we see poor Prometheus , who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods .
He was tied to a rock , and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver .
But of course his liver would regenerate every day , and so day after day he was punished for eternity by the gods .
And liver will regenerate in this very nice way , but actually if we think of other tissues , like cartilage , for example , even the simplest nick and you &apos;re going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage .
So it &apos;s going to be very different from tissue to tissue .
Now , bone is somewhere in between , and this is one of the tissues that we work on a lot in our lab .
And bone is actually quite good at repairing .
It has to be . We &apos;ve probably all had fractures at some point or other .
And one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here , called an iliac crest harvest .
And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest , which is just here , and then transplant that somewhere else in the body .
And it actually works really well , because it &apos;s your own bone , and it &apos;s well vascularized , which means it &apos;s got a really good blood supply .
But the problem is , there &apos;s only so much you can take , and also when you do that operation , your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation .
So what we were thinking is , there &apos;s a tremendous need for bone repair , of course , but this iliac crest-type approach really has a lot of limitations to it , and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very , very painful aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest ?
And so this is what we did , and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently .
And we simplified it a lot , so we got rid of a lot of these steps .
We got rid of the need to harvest cells from the patient , we got rid of the need to put in really fancy chemistries , and we got rid of the need to culture these scaffolds in the lab .
And what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple , but because we used it in a really clever way , we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach .
So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone .
And it &apos;s an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor , and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach .
And I &apos;ll talk you through this .
So what we do is , in humans , we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones .
That layer is called the periosteum .
And that layer is actually normally very , very tightly bound to the underlying bone , and it &apos;s got stem cells in it .
Those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops , and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you with repairing the bone .
So we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then , within 30 seconds , would turn into quite a rigid gel and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone .
So it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
And we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in , and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells , and they can form lots of new tissue , and then over time , you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body .
This is a histology slide of what we see when we do that , and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone .
So in this picture , you can see the middle of the leg , so the bone marrow , then you can see the original bone , and you can see where that original bone finishes , and just to the left of that is the new bone that &apos;s grown within that bioreactor cavity , and you can actually make it even larger .
And that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts as a very slight point of weakness , so actually now the surgeon can come along , can harvest away that new bone , and the periosteum can grow back , so you &apos;re left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn &apos;t operated on it in the first place .
So it &apos;s very , very low in terms of after-pain compared to an iliac crest harvest .
And you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there , so it really is an on demand sort of procedure .
Now , at the time that we did this , this received a lot of attention in the press , because it was a really nice way of generating new bone , and we got many , many contacts from different people that were interested in using this .
And I &apos;m just going to tell you , sometimes those contacts are very strange , slightly unexpected , and the very most interesting , let me put it that way , contact that I had , was actually from a team of American footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head .
And so you do get these kinds of contacts , and of course , being British and also growing up in France , I tend to be very blunt , and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case , there probably wasn &apos;t that much in there to protect in the first place .
So this was our approach , and it was simple materials , but we thought about it carefully .
And actually we know that those cells in the body , in the embryo , as they develop can form a different kind of tissue , cartilage , and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry , put it in there , and we were able to get 100 percent cartilage instead .
And this approach works really well , I think , for pre-planned procedures , but it &apos;s something you do have to pre-plan .
So for other kinds of operations , there &apos;s definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches .
And when you think about designing those other scaffolds , actually , you need a really multi-disciplinary team .
And so our team has chemists , it has cell biologists , surgeons , physicists even , and those people all come together and we think really hard about designing the materials .
But we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want , but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic .
And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body .
And so if we think of bone , obviously my own favorite tissue , we zoom in , we can see , even if you don &apos;t know anything about bone structure , it &apos;s beautifully organized , really beautifully organized .
We &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
And if we zoom in again , we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix of nano-scale fibers , and they give a lot of information to the cells .
And if we zoom in again , actually in the case of bone , the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale , and it &apos;s a hybrid material that &apos;s part organic , part inorganic .
And that &apos;s led to a whole field , really , that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure .
And so I &apos;m showing here just two examples where we &apos;ve made some materials that have that sort of structure , and you can really tailor it .
You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that &apos;s also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness , and it &apos;s no longer brittle .
And an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
One other thing I want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make are porous , and they have to be , because you want blood vessels to grow in there .
But the pores are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells , and so even though it &apos;s 3D , the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface , and that &apos;s a little bit unnatural .
And so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3D and give them a little bit more information .
And there &apos;s a lot of work going on in both of these areas .
Now finally , I just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease , because this is a really big clinical problem .
And one of the things that we know is that , unfortunately , if you have a heart attack , then that tissue can start to die , and your outcome may not be very good over time .
And it would be really great , actually , if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate .
And there &apos;s lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide , and they use many different types of cells , but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually , very often , those cells will die once you &apos;ve implanted them .
And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system , but either way , we don &apos;t seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes .
And so some of the things that we &apos;re thinking of , and many other people in the field are thinking of , are actually developing materials for that .
But there &apos;s a difference here .
We still need chemistry , we still need mechanics , we still need really interesting topography , and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells .
But now , the cells also would probably quite like a material that &apos;s going to be able to be conductive , because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves .
You can see them now beating synchronously on these materials , and that &apos;s a very , very exciting development that &apos;s going on .
So just to wrap up , I &apos;d like to actually say that being able to work in this sort of field , all of us that work in this field that &apos;s not only super-exciting science , but also has the potential to impact on patients , however big or small they are , is really a great privilege .
And so for that , I &apos;d like to thank all of you as well .
Thank you .

Rupal Patel : Synthetic voices , as unique as fingerprints
Many of those with severe speech disorders use a computerized device to communicate . Yet they choose between only a few voice options . That &apos;s why Stephen Hawking has an American accent , and why many people end up with the same voice , often to incongruous effect . Speech scientist Rupal Patel wanted to do something about this , and in this wonderful talk she shares her work to engineer unique voices for the voiceless .
I &apos;d like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are : our voice .
Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age , our size , even our lifestyle and personality .
In the words of the poet Longfellow , &quot; the human voice is the organ of the soul . &quot;
As a speech scientist , I &apos;m fascinated by how the voice is produced , and I have an idea for how it can be engineered .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
I &apos;m going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize .
Stephen Hawking : &quot; I would have thought it was fairly obvious what I meant . &quot;
Rupal Patel : That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking .
What you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition .
In fact , all of these individuals may be using the same voice , and that &apos;s because there &apos;s only a few options available .
In the U.S. alone , there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak , and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate .
Now that &apos;s millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices , including Professor Hawking , who uses an American-accented voice .
This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago , and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices , different devices , but the same voice .
And I looked around and I saw this happening all around me , literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices , voices that didn &apos;t fit their bodies or their personalities .
We wouldn &apos;t dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man .
So why then the same prosthetic voice ?
It really struck me , and I wanted to do something about this .
I &apos;m going to play you now a sample of someone who has , two people actually , who have severe speech disorders .
I want you to take a listen to how they sound .
They &apos;re saying the same utterance .
You probably didn &apos;t understand what they said , but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities .
So what I wanted to do next is , I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them , voices that could be customized for them .
So I reached out to my collaborator , Tim Bunnell .
Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis , and what he &apos;d been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together pre-recorded samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them .
These are people who had lost their voice later in life .
We didn &apos;t have the luxury of pre-recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
But I thought , there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over .
So we decided to do exactly that .
We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation , to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities .
We call this project VocaliD , or vocal I.D. , for vocal identity .
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it , I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson . Okay ?
So first , we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development .
Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults .
We &apos;ve all experienced this .
Fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source , which is the vibrations generated by your voice box , which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract .
These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate , and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels .
So the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech .
And that happens in one individual .
Now I told you earlier that I &apos;d spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder , and what I &apos;ve found is that even though their filters were impaired , they were able to modulate their source : the pitch , the loudness , the tempo of their voice .
These are called prosody , and I &apos;ve been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved .
So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity , I had this idea .
Why don &apos;t we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like , because it &apos;s preserved , and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size , because they can articulate speech , and then mix them ?
Because when we mix them , we can get a voice that &apos;s as clear as our surrogate talker -- that &apos;s the person we borrowed the filter from — and is similar in identity to our target talker .
It &apos;s that simple .
That &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
So once you have that in mind , how do you go about building this voice ?
Well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
It &apos;s not such an ominous thing .
Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances .
The process goes something like this .
Voice : Things happen in pairs .
I love to sleep .
The sky is blue without clouds .
RP : Now she &apos;s going to go on like this for about three to four hours , and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say , but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language .
The more speech you have , the better sounding voice you &apos;re going to have .
Once you have those recordings , what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech , one- or two-sound combinations , sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database .
We &apos;re going to call this database a voice bank .
Now the power of the voice bank we can now say any new utterance , like , &quot; I love chocolate &quot; -- everyone needs to be able to say that — fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance .
Voice : I love chocolate .
RP : So that &apos;s speech synthesis .
It &apos;s called concatenative synthesis , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re using .
That &apos;s not the novel part .
What &apos;s novel is how we make it sound like this young woman .
This is Samantha .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
We first had to find a surrogate donor , and then we had to have Samantha produce some utterances .
What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds , but that &apos;s enough for us to extract her source characteristics .
What happens next is best described by my daughter &apos;s analogy . She &apos;s six .
She calls it mixing colors to paint voices .
It &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s exactly that .
Samantha &apos;s voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice just like this .
Samantha : Aaaaaah .
RP : So now , Samantha can say this .
Samantha : This voice is only for me .
I can &apos;t wait to use my new voice with my friends .
RP : Thank you . I &apos;ll never forget the gentle smile that spread across her face when she heard that voice for the first time .
Now there &apos;s millions of people around the world like Samantha , millions , and we &apos;ve only begun to scratch the surface .
What we &apos;ve done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
But there &apos;s so much more work to be done .
For Samantha , her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest , a stranger who gave her the gift of voice .
And as a scientist , I &apos;m so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real-world impact .
What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level .
I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life , different sizes , different ages , coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities .
To do that as a first step , we &apos;ve put together this website , VocaliD.org , as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors , as expertise donors , in whatever way to make this vision a reality .
They say that giving blood can save lives .
Well , giving your voice can change lives .
All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker , and as little as a vowel from our target talker , to create a unique vocal identity .
So that &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work .
About five years ago , we built our very first voice for a little boy named William .
When his mom first heard this voice , she said , &quot; This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak . &quot;
And then I saw William typing a message on his device .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
Imagine carrying around someone else &apos;s voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice .
Imagine that .
This is what William said : &quot; Never heard me before . &quot;
Thank you .

Chris McKnett : The investment logic for sustainability
Sustainability is pretty clearly one of the world &apos;s most important goals ; but what groups can really make environmental progress in leaps and bounds ? Chris McKnett makes the case that it &apos;s large institutional investors . He shows how strong financial data isn &apos;t enough , and reveals why investors need to look at a company &apos;s environmental , social and governance structures , too .
The world is changing in some really profound ways , and I worry that investors aren &apos;t paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change , especially when it comes to sustainability .
And by sustainability , I mean the really juicy things , like environmental and social issues and corporate governance .
I think it &apos;s reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns .
And here &apos;s something that may surprise you : the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors , the large investors like pension funds , foundations and endowments .
I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think , better-performing than you believe , and more important than we can imagine .
Let me remind you what we already know .
We have a population that &apos;s both growing and aging ; we have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the century ; we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished ; and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing .
Now clearly , these are environmental and social issues , but that &apos;s not all .
They &apos;re economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
And they are really complex and they can seem really far off , that the temptation may be to do this : bury our heads in the sand and not think about it .
Resist this , if you can . Don &apos;t do this at home .
But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow .
We know that investors , when they look at a company and decide whether to invest , they look at financial data , metrics like sales growth , cash flow , market share , valuation -- you know , the really sexy stuff .
And these things are fundamental , of course , but they &apos;re not enough .
Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG : environment , social and governance .
Environment includes energy consumption , water availability , waste and pollution , just making efficient uses of resources .
Social includes human capital , things like employee engagement and innovation capacity , as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights .
And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors .
See , I told you this is the really juicy stuff .
But ESG is the measure of sustainability , and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process .
It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet , and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes .
So if sustainability matters financially today , and all signs indicate more tomorrow , is the private sector paying attention ?
Well , the really cool thing is that most CEOs are .
They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success .
About 80 percent of global CEOs see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries .
But 93 percent see ESG as the future , or as important to the future of their business .
So the views of CEOs are clear .
There &apos;s tremendous opportunity in sustainability .
So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results ?
One example is near and dear to our hearts .
In 2012 , State Street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment , and we retired another 85 .
We virtualized our operating system environments , and we completed numerous automation projects .
Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace , and they reduce our real estate footprint , and they yield savings of 23 million dollars in operating costs annually , and avoid the emissions of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon .
That &apos;s the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars off the road .
So awesome , right ?
Another example is Pentair .
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate , and about a decade ago , they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business .
That &apos;s a really big bet . Why did they do that ?
Well , with apologies to the Home Improvement fans , there &apos;s more growth in water than in power tools , and this company has their sights set on what they call &quot; the new New World . &quot;
That &apos;s four billion middle class people demanding food , energy and water .
Now , you may be asking yourself , are these just isolated cases ?
I mean , come on , really ?
Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially ?
The answer that may surprise you is yes .
The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others .
In blue , we see the MSCI World .
It &apos;s an index of large companies from developed markets across the world .
And in gold , we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance .
Over three plus years , no performance tradeoff .
So that &apos;s okay , right ? We want more . I want more .
In some cases , there may be outperformance from ESG .
In blue , we see the performance of the 500 largest global companies , and in gold , we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management .
Now over almost eight years , they &apos;ve outperformed by about two thirds .
So yes , this is correlation . It &apos;s not causation .
But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns .
So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits , wouldn &apos;t this be the norm ?
Are investors , particularly institutional investors , Well , some are , and a few are really at the vanguard .
Hesta .
Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia , with assets of 22 billion &#91; dollars &#93; .
They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns , so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members , core to their duty .
You gotta love the Aussies , right ?
CalPERS is another example .
CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California , and with assets of 244 billion &#91; dollars &#93; , they are the second largest in the U.S.
and the sixth largest in the world .
Now , they &apos;re moving toward 100 percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund .
Why ? They believe it &apos;s critical to superior long-term returns , full stop .
In their own words , &quot; long-term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital : financial , human , and physical .
This is why we are concerned with ESG . &quot;
Now , I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job , and not all of them see it this way .
Often I hear , &quot; We are required to maximize returns , so we don &apos;t do that here , &quot; or , &quot; We don &apos;t want to use the portfolio to make policy statements . &quot;
The one that just really gets under my skin is , &quot; If you want to do something about that , just make money , give the profits to charities . &quot;
I mean , let me clarify something right here .
Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet .
They don &apos;t have indefinite social obligations , and prudent investing and finance theory aren &apos;t subordinate to sustainability .
They &apos;re compatible .
So I &apos;m not talking about tradeoffs here .
But institutional investors are the x-factor in sustainability .
Why do they hold the key ?
The answer , quite simply , is , they have the money .
A lot of it .
I mean , a really lot of it .
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars .
The global bond market , 78 trillion .
That &apos;s 133 trillion combined .
That &apos;s eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
That &apos;s the world &apos;s largest economy .
That &apos;s some serious freaking firepower .
So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges , like fresh water , clean air , feeding 10 billion mouths , if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment .
What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them ?
What if we work and save and invest , only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now ?
What if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
Now a fair question might be , what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated , overstated , it &apos;s not urgent , something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice ?
Well , President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on : &quot; There are risks and costs to a program of action , but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction . &quot;
I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this , but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus , the odds that it &apos;s not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we &apos;ll get in a car accident .
Well , maybe not if you live in Boston . But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen , right ?
So by investing sustainably we &apos;re doing two things .
We &apos;re creating insurance , reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy , and at the same time , in the short term , we &apos;re not sacrificing performance .
&#91; Man in comic : &quot; What if it &apos;s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? &quot; &#93; Good , you like it . I like it too . I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue .
I bet you can &apos;t guess which side I &apos;m on .
But what I really like about it is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said , which is , &quot; Plan for the future , because that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to spend the rest of your life . &quot;
Thank you .

Aparna Rao : Art that craves your attention
In this charming talk , artist Aparna Rao shows us her latest work : cool , cartoony sculptures that play with your perception -- and crave your attention . Take a few minutes to simply be delighted .
Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
So this is the sketch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
The next work is Decoy .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
So here is the first test scenario .
You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
And here is a prototype .
So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
It comes out of the idea of a window .
This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
Thank you .

Teddy Cruz : How architectural innovations migrate across borders
As the world &apos;s cities undergo explosive growth , inequality is intensifying . Wealthy neighborhoods and impoverished slums grow side by side , the gap between them widening . In this eye-opening talk , architect Teddy Cruz asks us to rethink urban development from the bottom up . Sharing lessons from the slums of Tijuana , Cruz explores the creative intelligence of the city &apos;s residents and offers a fresh perspective on what we can learn from places of scarcity .
The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization , resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world .
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today &apos;s urban crisis .
But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental .
It &apos;s particularly a cultural crisis , a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing , unable to challenge the oil-hungry , selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption , from southern California to New York to Dubai .
So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and , in fact , depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations , that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance , but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today .
And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity , as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana-San Diego border region , which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect .
This is the wall , the border wall , that separates San Diego and Tijuana , Latin America and the United States , a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities , jurisdictions and resources across the world .
In this border region , we find some of the wealthiest real estate , as I once found in the edges of San Diego , barely 20 minutes away from some of the poorest settlements in Latin America .
And while these two cities have the same population , San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades , immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density , which are at the center of today &apos;s discussion about environmental sustainability .
So I &apos;ve been arguing in the last years that , in fact , the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability , that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization .
What do I mean by the informal in this case ?
I &apos;m really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
I &apos;m talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up , whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves , in fact , with the waste of San Diego , or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades .
So I &apos;ve been interested as an artist in the measuring , the observation , of many of the trans-border informal flows across this border : in one direction , from south to north , the flow of immigrants into the United States , and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana .
I &apos;m referring to the recycling of these old post-war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades .
So these are houses waiting to cross the border .
Not only people cross the border here , but entire chunks of one city move to the next , and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames , they leave the first floor to become the second to be in-filled with more house , with a small business .
This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice .
But not only houses , also small debris from one city , from San Diego , to Tijuana .
Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls .
But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency .
They have figured out how to peel off the tire , how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall .
Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana .
So while , as an architect , this is a very compelling thing to witness , this creative intelligence , I also want to keep myself in check .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize poverty .
I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness , that informality here , the informal , is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists , that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs .
See here , buildings are not important just for their looks , but , in fact , they are important for what they can do .
They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
So while waste flows southbound , people go north in search of dollars , and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States , particularly in San Diego .
And I &apos;m talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on steroids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
I &apos;m referring to how immigrants , when they come to these neighborhoods , they begin to alter the one-dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems , as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage , or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family .
This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new , inclusive and more equitable land use policies .
So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space , such as &amp; amp ; quot ; the informal Buddha , &amp; amp ; quot ; which tells the story of a small house that saved itself , it did not travel to Mexico , but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple , and in so doing , this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small , or a micro , socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood .
So these action neighborhoods , as I call them , really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do , in fact , with belonging to the nation-state , and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city .
As an artist , I &apos;ve been interested , in fact , in the visualization of citizenship , the gathering of many anecdotes , urban stories , in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces .
This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night , a few months ago , decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park .
With shovels in hand , they started to dig .
Two weeks later , the police stopped them .
They barricaded the place , and the teenagers were evicted , and the teenagers decided to fight back , not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process .
The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space .
They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy .
Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway , so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them .
They were lucky , they said , because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality .
They were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space .
With this knowledge , these teenagers as skaters confronted the city .
They came to the city attorney &apos;s office .
The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO , and of course they didn &apos;t know what an NGO was .
They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience .
And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise , to organize budgets , to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city , expanding it to other categories .
At the end , the teenagers won the case with that evidence , and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway .
Now for many of you , this story might seem trivial or naive .
For me as an architect , it has become a fundamental narrative , because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability .
They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border , they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool , because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city .
In that act , that informal , bottom-up act of transgression , really began to trickle up to transform top-down policy .
Now this journey from the bottom-up to the transformation of the top-down is where I find hope today .
And I &apos;m thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world , in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance , social organization , and infrastructure , really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban .
It is , in fact , this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city .
I want to say this and emphasize it , because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today .
Thank you .

Maya Penn : Meet a young entrepreneur , cartoonist , designer , activist …
Maya Penn started her first company when she was 8 years old , and thinks deeply about how to be responsible both to her customers and to the planet . She shares her story -- and some animations , and some designs , and some infectious energy -- in this charming talk .
Server : May I help you , sir ?
Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
Server : We have pan seared registry error sprinkled with the finest corrupted data , binary brioche , RAM sandwiches , Conficker fitters , and a scripting salad with or without polymorphic dressing , and a grilled coding kabob .
Customer : I &apos;d like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39 .
Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
Our special is tracking cookie .
Customer : I &apos;d like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies , thank you .
Server : Coming right up , sir .
Your food will be served shortly .
Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot;
I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
Animation and art has always been my first love .
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot;
There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
And thus , &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; was born .
At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
That started my love for technology .
I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; The Pollinators . &quot;
It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
Thank you . All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
Ideas can spark a movement .
Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &amp; amp ; quot ; This could be a scarf or a hat , &amp; amp ; quot ; and I had all these ideas for designs .
I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
And I thought , I can start my own business .
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
My mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon , and I would write down the names and the price of each item .
I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
Soon , my business really started to take off .
Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
Thank you , and peace and blessings .
Thank you . Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just -- Ah !

Nicolas Perony : Puppies ! Now that I &apos;ve got your attention , complexity theory
Animal behavior isn &apos;t complicated , but it is complex . Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals -- be they Scottish Terriers , bats or meerkats -- follow simple rules that , collectively , create larger patterns of behavior . And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances , as they arise .
Science , science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe , which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote , and yet much , much closer , much more directly related to us , there are many things we don &apos;t really understand .
And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us , and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity .
But first , what do we call complexity ?
What is complex ?
Well , complex is not complicated .
Something complicated comprises many small parts , all different , and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery .
On the opposite , a complex system is made of many , many similar parts , and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior .
Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple , individual rules , and this results in emergent properties .
The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only .
As Aristotle wrote , the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
But from Aristotle , let &apos;s move onto a more concrete example of complex systems .
These are Scottish terriers .
In the beginning , the system is disorganized .
Then comes a perturbation : milk .
Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction .
So it &apos;s all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges .
I call this simplifying complexity , and it &apos;s what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich .
We collect data on animal populations , analyze complex patterns , try to explain them .
It requires physicists who work with biologists , with mathematicians and computer scientists , and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems .
So again , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts .
In a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
And you may be asking yourself which side I &apos;m on , biology or physics ?
In fact , it &apos;s a little different , and to explain , I need to tell you a short story about myself .
When I was a child , I loved to build stuff , to create complicated machines .
So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics , and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called ER-1 -- it looked like this — that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground .
It was very , very complicated , but it worked beautifully in our test room , and on demo day , professors had assembled to grade the project .
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room .
It turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
The robot &apos;s vision system got confused .
At the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crashed into a wall .
We had spent weeks building it , and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room .
That &apos;s when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine , the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected .
And I decided that , in fact , I didn &apos;t really want to create complicated stuff .
I wanted to understand complexity , the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom .
Which brings us to bats .
Bechstein &apos;s bats are a common species of European bats .
They are very social animals .
Mostly they roost , or sleep , together .
And they live in maternity colonies , which means that every spring , the females meet after the winter hibernation , and they stay together for about six months to rear their young , and they all carry a very small chip , which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes , we know where she is , and more importantly , we know with whom she is .
So I study roosting associations in bats , and this is what it looks like .
During the day , the bats roost in a number of sub-groups in different boxes .
It could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
It &apos;s called fission-fusion dynamics , the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups .
So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
Okay ? So that &apos;s what this picture looks like .
In this network , all the circles are nodes , individual bats , and the lines between them are social bonds , associations between individuals .
It turns out this is a very interesting picture .
This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission-fusion dynamics .
We call them cryptic social units .
Even more interesting , in fact : Every year , around October , the colony splits up , and all bats hibernate separately , but year after year , when the bats come together again in the spring , the communities stay the same .
So these bats remember their friends for a really long time .
With a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , We didn &apos;t know that was possible .
We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that , but compared to bats , they have huge brains .
So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex , stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities ?
And this is where complexity brings an answer .
To understand this system , we built a computer model of roosting , based on simple , individual rules , and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony .
It &apos;s a mathematical model , but it &apos;s not complicated .
What the model told us is that , in a nutshell , each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends , and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them .
Simple , individual rules .
This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats .
But it gets better .
Between 2010 and 2011 , the colony lost more than two thirds of its members , probably due to the very cold winter .
The next spring , it didn &apos;t form two communities like every year , which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small .
Instead , it formed a single , cohesive social unit , which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years .
What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this .
All they do is follow simple association rules , and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure .
And I find this incredible .
Now I want to tell you another story , but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa .
This is where meerkats live .
I &apos;m sure you know meerkats .
They &apos;re fascinating creatures .
They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
There is one dominant pair , and many subordinates , some acting as sentinels , some acting as babysitters , some teaching pups , and so on .
What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together , and what this has to do with their social structure .
And there &apos;s a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats .
In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road .
On this road there are cars , so it &apos;s dangerous .
But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another .
So we asked , how exactly do they do this ?
We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road , but when it comes to crossing it , crossing the road , she gives way to the subordinates , a manner of saying , &quot; Go ahead , tell me if it &apos;s safe . &quot;
What I didn &apos;t know , in fact , was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it .
So I built a model , a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road .
It &apos;s a simplistic model .
Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment .
They simply move together .
When these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
The only difference between the dominant female , here in red , and the other individuals , is that for her , the height of the obstacle , which is in fact the risk perceived from the road , is just slightly higher , and this tiny difference in the individual &apos;s rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe , that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first .
George Box , who was an English statistician , once wrote , &quot; All models are false , but some models are useful . &quot;
And in fact , this model is obviously false , because in reality , meerkats are anything but random particles .
But it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
So again , that &apos;s simplifying complexity .
I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species .
When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate , it &apos;s not out of courtesy .
In fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
If she dies on the road , the whole group is at risk .
So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old , and they &apos;re adapting it to a modern risk , in this case a road built by humans .
They adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat .
In the end , it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash , or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road , or it may be another species .
My message here -- and it &apos;s not a complicated one , but a simple one of wonder and hope -- my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity , and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment .
In three words , in the animal kingdom , simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience .
Thank you .
Dania Gerhardt : Thank you very much , Nicolas , for this great start . Little bit nervous ?
Nicolas Perony : I &apos;m okay , thanks .
Okay , great . I &apos;m sure a lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about -- the bats , meerkats -- and humans .
You brought some examples : The females are the social ones , the females are the dominant ones , I &apos;m not sure who thinks how .
But is it okay to do these associations ?
Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species ?
NP : Well , I would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes .
For examples , in sea horses or in koalas , in fact , it is the males who take care of the young always .
And the lesson is that it &apos;s often difficult , and sometimes even a bit dangerous , to draw parallels between humans and animals .
So that &apos;s it .
Okay . Thank you very much for this great start .
Thank you , Nicolas Perony .
McKenna Pope : Want to be an activist ? Start with your toys
McKenna Pope &apos;s younger brother loved to cook , but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls . So at age 13 , Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing . In a heartening talk , Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless .
I &apos;m McKenna Pope . I &apos;m 14 years old , and when I was 13 , I convinced one of the largest toy companies , toymakers , in the world , Hasbro , to change the way that they marketed one of their most best-selling products .
So allow me to tell you about it .
So I have a brother , Gavin .
When this whole shebang happened , he was four .
He loved to cook .
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these , needless to say , uneatable concoctions , or making invisible macaroni and cheese .
He wanted to be a chef really badly .
And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy-Bake Oven . Right ?
I mean , we all had those when we were little .
And he wanted one so badly .
But then he started to realize something .
In the commercials , and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens , Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials , and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple , very gender-specific colors to females , right ?
So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
And this discouraged my brother a lot .
He thought that he wasn &apos;t supposed to want to be a chef , because that was something that girls did .
Girls cooked ; boys didn &apos;t , or so was the message that Hasbro was sending .
And this got me thinking , God , I wish there was a way that I could change this , that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it .
And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org.
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through Facebook , through Twitter , through YouTube , through Reddit , through Tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it , in featuring boys in the commercials , on the boxes , and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors .
So this petition started to take off -- humongously fast , you have no idea .
I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets , and it was amazing .
In three weeks , maybe three and a half , I had 46,000 signatures on this petition .
Thank you .
So , needless to say , it was crazy .
Eventually , Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me in black , silver and blue .
It was literally one of the best moments of my life .
It was like &amp; amp ; quot ; Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory . &amp; amp ; quot ; That thing was amazing .
What I didn &apos;t realize at the time , however , was that I had become an activist , I could change something , that even as a kid , or maybe even especially as a kid , my voice mattered , and your voice matters too .
I want to let you know it &apos;s not going to be easy , and it wasn &apos;t easy for me , because I faced a lot of obstacles .
People online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
And actually , I have some examples , because what &apos;s better revenge than displaying their idiocy ?
So , let &apos;s see .
From user name Liquidsore29 -- interesting user names we have here — &amp; amp ; quot ; Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay . &amp; amp ; quot ; Liquidsore29 , really ? Really ? Okay .
How about from Whiteboy77AGS : &quot; People always need something to about . &quot;
From Jeffrey Gutierrez : &amp; amp ; quot ; OMG , shut up . You just want money and attention . &amp; amp ; quot ; So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought , people don &apos;t care , people think it &apos;s a waste of time , and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family .
It hurt me , and it made me think , what &apos;s the point of making change in the future ?
But then I started to realize something .
Haters gonna hate .
Come on , say it with me . One , two , three : Haters gonna hate .
So let your haters hate , you know what , and make your change , because I know you can .
I look out into this crowd , and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change , and I know that you can , and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in , and you can trade it across all these social media , through Facebook , through Twitter , through YouTube , through Reddit , through Tumblr , through whatever else you can think of .
And you can make that change .
You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it .
And that spark that you &apos;ve been hearing about all day today , and turn it into a fire .
Thank you .

Anant Agarwal : Why massive open online courses matter
2013 was a year of hype for MOOCs . Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results . But the head of edX , Anant Agarwal , makes the case that MOOCs still matter -- as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement traditional classrooms . Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning , where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students .
I &apos;d like to reimagine education .
The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word .
It starts with an M.
MOOC : massive open online courses .
Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it .
Now , in this discussion today , I &apos;m going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs .
We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom .
So , here &apos;s a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the Northeast of America , MIT .
And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago , and this is a classroom today .
What &apos;s changed ?
The seats are in color .
Whoop-de-do .
Education really hasn &apos;t changed in the past 500 years .
The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks .
Everything else has changed around us .
You know , from healthcare to transportation , everything is different , but education hasn &apos;t changed .
It &apos;s also been a real issue in terms of access .
So what you see here is not a rock concert .
And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna .
This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria .
Now , we &apos;ve all heard of distance education , but the students way in the back , 200 feet away from the instructor , I think they are undergoing long-distance education .
Now , I really believe that we can transform education , both in quality and scale and access , through technology .
For example , at edX , we are trying to transform education through online technologies .
Given education has been calcified for 500 years , we really cannot think about reengineering it , We really have to completely reimagine it .
It &apos;s like going from ox carts to the airplane .
Even the infrastructure has to change .
Everything has to change .
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises , online videos .
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification .
We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
Everything really has to change .
So at edX and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education .
And you heard of this example , where , when we launched our very first course -- and this was an MIT-hard circuits and electronics course -- about a year and a half ago , 155,000 students from 162 countries enrolled in this course .
And we had no marketing budget .
Now , 155,000 is a big number .
This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history .
7,200 students passed the course , and this was a hard course .
7,200 is also a big number .
If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year , I would have to teach for 40 years before I could teach this many students .
Now these large numbers are just one part of the story .
So today , I want to discuss a different aspect , the other side of MOOCs , We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom , to create a blended model of learning .
But before I go into that , let me tell you a story .
When my daughter turned 13 , became a teenager , she stopped speaking English , and she began speaking this new language .
I call it teen-lish .
It &apos;s a digital language .
It &apos;s got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
&quot; Honey , come over for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Hmm . &quot;
&quot; Did you hear me ? &quot;
Silence . &quot; Can you listen to me ? &quot;
&amp; amp ; quot ; Hmm . &amp; amp ; quot ; So we had a real issue with communicating , until one day I had this epiphany .
I texted her . I got an instant response .
She must have thought , you know , some friend of hers was calling her .
So I texted her again . Boom , another response .
I said , this is great .
And so since then , our life has changed .
I text her , she responds .
It &apos;s just been absolutely great .
So our millennial generation is built differently .
Now , I &apos;m older , and my youthful looks might belie that , but I &apos;m not in the millennial generation .
But our kids are really different .
The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology .
So why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
Let &apos;s not fight it . Let &apos;s embrace it .
In fact , I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs , I can &apos;t text very well -- but I &apos;m willing to bet that with evolution , our kids and their grandchildren will develop really , really little , itty-bitty thumbs to text much better , that evolution will fix all of that stuff .
But what if we embraced technology , embraced the millennial generation &apos;s natural predilections , and really think about creating these online technologies , blend them into their lives .
So here &apos;s what we can do .
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom , herding them out there at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms , in their bedroom , in the dining room , in the bathroom , wherever they &apos;re most creative .
Then they come into the classroom for some in-person interaction . They can have discussions amongst themselves .
They can solve problems together .
They can work with the professor In fact , with edX , when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world , this was happening unbeknownst to us .
Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom , and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises , where the learners in the high school , 15-year-olds , mind you , would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class , and as you see from this image here , they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work .
And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog .
We were also doing other pilots .
So we did a pilot experimental blended courses , working with San Jose State University in California , again , with the circuits and electronics course .
You &apos;ll hear that a lot . That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning .
the instructors flipped the classroom , blended online and in person , and the results were staggering .
Now don &apos;t take these results to the bank just yet .
Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more , but the early results are incredible .
So traditionally , semester upon semester , for the past several years , this course , again , a hard course , had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent every semester .
With this blended class late last year , the failure rate fell to nine percent .
So the results can be extremely , extremely good .
Now before we go too far into this , I &apos;d like to spend some time discussing some key ideas .
What are some key ideas that makes all of this work ?
One idea is active learning .
The idea here is , rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures , we replace this with what we call lessons .
Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
So a student might watch a five- , seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise .
Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education .
You teach by asking questions .
And this is a form of learning called active learning , and really promoted by a very early paper , in 1972 , by Craik and Lockhart , where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing .
Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material .
The second idea is self-pacing .
Now , when I went to a lecture hall , and if you were like me , by the fifth minute I would lose the professor .
I wasn &apos;t all that smart , and I would be scrambling , taking notes , and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
Instead , wouldn &apos;t it be nice with online technologies , we offer videos and interactive engagements to students ?
They can hit the pause button .
They can rewind the professor .
Heck , they can even mute the professor .
So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning .
The third idea that we have is instant feedback .
the computer grades exercises .
I mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
Your computer is grading all the exercises .
And we &apos;ve all submitted homeworks , and your grades come back two weeks later , you &apos;ve forgotten all about it .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days .
Some are never graded .
So with instant feedback , students can try to apply answers .
If they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
They can try it again and try it again , and this really becomes much more engaging . They get the instant feedback , and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX .
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark .
In fact , one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year , he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year , and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board about the green check mark : &amp; amp ; quot ; Oh god ; have I missed you . &amp; amp ; quot ; When &apos;s the last time you &apos;ve seen students posting comments like this about homework ?
My colleague Ed Bertschinger , who heads up the physics department at MIT , has this to say about instant feedback : He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes .
The next big idea is gamification .
You know , all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on .
You know , they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it .
So we applied these gamification techniques to learning , and we can build these online laboratories .
How do you teach creativity ? How do you teach design ?
So as this little video shows here , you can engage students So here , the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease .
And this can also be graded by the computer .
Fifth is peer learning .
So here , we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook-like interaction not as a distraction , but to really help students learn .
Let me tell you a story .
When we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , I didn &apos;t sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
I told my TAs , okay , 24 / 7 , we &apos;re going to be up monitoring the forum , answering questions .
They had answered questions for 100 students .
How do you do that for 150,000 ?
So one night I &apos;m sitting up there , at 2 a.m. at night , and I think there &apos;s this question from a student from Pakistan , and he asked a question , and I said , okay , let me go and type up an answer , I don &apos;t type all that fast , and before I can finish , another student from Egypt popped in with an answer , not quite right , so I &apos;m fixing the answer , and before I can finish , a student from the U.S.
had popped in with a different answer .
Boom , boom , boom , boom , the students were discussing and interacting with each other , and by 4 a.m. that night , I &apos;m totally fascinated , and by 4 a.m. in the morning , they had discovered the right answer .
And all I had to do was go and bless it , &quot; Good answer . &quot;
So this is absolutely amazing , where students are learning from each other , and they &apos;re telling us that they are learning by teaching .
Now this is all not just in the future .
This is happening today .
So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world , from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- And these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs , the business aspect .
We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities , and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs , where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next-generation textbook .
They can use as much or as little as they like , and it becomes a tool in the teacher &apos;s arsenal .
Finally , I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit .
I would like us to really reimagine education .
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces .
We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi , 20 dollars .
The Aakash is 40 dollars .
We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories .
But I think at the end of the day , I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities .
Otherwise , how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and , you know , you didn &apos;t even have a rewind button ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yves Morieux : As work gets more complex , 6 rules to simplify
Why do people feel so miserable and disengaged at work ? Because today &apos;s businesses are increasingly and dizzyingly complex -- and traditional pillars of management are obsolete , says Yves Morieux . So , he says , it falls to individual employees to navigate the rabbit &apos;s warren of interdependencies . In this energetic talk , Morieux offers six rules for &quot; smart simplicity . &quot;
I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas : Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work ?
I have worked with more than 500 companies .
Despite all the technological advances -- computers , I.T. , communications , telecommunications , the Internet .
Enigma number two : Why is there so little engagement at work ?
Why do people feel so miserable , even actively disengaged ?
Disengaging their colleagues .
Acting against the interest of their company .
Despite all the affiliation events , the celebration , the people initiatives , the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams .
At the beginning , I thought there was a chicken and egg issue : Because people are less engaged , they are less productive .
Or vice versa , because they are less productive , we put more pressure and they are less engaged .
But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
The way we organize is based on two pillars .
The hard -- structure , processes , systems .
The soft -- feelings , sentiments , interpersonal relationships , traits , personality .
And whenever a company reorganizes , restructures , reengineers , goes through a cultural transformation program , it chooses these two pillars .
Now , we try to refine them , we try to combine them .
The real issue is -- and this is the answer to the two enigmas -- these pillars are obsolete .
Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination .
They are obsolete .
How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business ?
The hard approach , basically is that you start from strategy , requirements , structures , processes , systems , KPIs , scorecards , committees , headquarters , hubs , clusters , you name it .
I forgot all the metrics , incentives , committees , middle offices and interfaces .
What happens basically on the left , you have more complexity , the new complexity of business .
We need quality , cost , reliability , speed .
And every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
We create dedicated structure processed systems , basically to deal with the new complexity of business .
The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization .
Let &apos;s take an example .
An automotive company , the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix .
If you open any cell of the matrix , you find another 20-dimensional matrix .
You have Mr. Noise , Mr. Petrol Consumption , Mr. Anti-Collision Properties .
For any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
What happens when the new requirement emerges ?
Some years ago , a new requirement appeared on the marketplace : the length of the warranty period .
So therefore the new requirement is repairability , making cars easy to repair .
Otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light , if you have to remove the engine to access the lights , the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours , and the warranty budget will explode .
So , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
If repairability is the new requirement , the solution is to create a new function , Mr. Repairability .
And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process .
With a repairability scorecard , with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive .
That came on top of 25 other KPIs .
What percentage of these people is variable compensation ?
Twenty percent at most , divided by 26 KPIs , repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent .
What difference did it make in their actions , their choices to simplify ? Zero .
But what occurs for zero impact ? Mr. Repairability , process , scorecard , evaluation , coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact .
Now , in front of the new complexity of business , the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines .
It is basically the interplay .
How the parts work together .
The connections , the interactions , the synapses .
It is not the skeleton of boxes , it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence .
You know , you could call it cooperation , basically .
Whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . In everything .
You know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
When you design cars , please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages .
When we don &apos;t cooperate we need more time , more equipment , more systems , more teams .
We need -- When procurement , supply chain , manufacturing don &apos;t cooperate we need more stock , more inventories , more working capital .
Who will pay for that ?
Shareholders ? Customers ?
No , they will refuse .
So who is left ? The employees , who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation .
Stress , burnout , they are overwhelmed , accidents .
No wonder they disengage .
How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation ?
The hard : In banks , when there is a problem between the back office and the front office , they don &apos;t cooperate . What is the solution ?
They create a middle office .
What happens one year later ?
Instead of one problem between the back and the front , now I have two problems .
Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front .
Plus I have to pay for the middle office .
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation .
It can only add new boxes , new bones in the skeleton .
The soft approach : To make people cooperate , we need to make them like each other .
Improve interpersonal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
It is totally wrong .
It is even counterproductive .
Look , at home I have two TVs . Why ?
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife .
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife .
And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife .
If I didn &apos;t love my wife , one TV would be enough : You will watch my favorite football game , if you are not happy , how is the book or the door ?
The more we like each other , the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs .
And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration .
Definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
To deal with complexity , to enhance the nervous system , we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules .
Simple rule number one : Understand what others do .
What is their real work ?
We need to go beyond the boxes , the job descriptions , beyond the surface of the container , to understand the real content .
Me , designer , if I put a wire here , I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights .
Second , you need to reenforce integrators .
Integrators are not middle offices , they are managers , existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate .
How can you reinforce your managers as integrators ?
By removing layers .
When there are too many layers people are too far from the action , therefore they need KPIs , metrics , they need poor proxies for reality .
They don &apos;t understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics , KPIs .
By removing rules -- the bigger we are , the more we need integrators , therefore the less rules we must have , to give discretionary power to managers .
And we do the opposite -- the bigger we are , the more rules we create .
And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules .
You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment , their intelligence .
You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate , to move out of insulation .
Otherwise , they will withdraw . They will disengage .
These rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
You can increase the shadow of the future .
Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions .
This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact .
They said to the design engineers : Now , in three years , when the new car is launched on the market , you will move to the after sales network , and become in charge of the warranty budget , and if the warranty budget explodes , it will explode in your face . Much more powerful than 0.8 percent variable compensation .
You need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient .
When you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , I hold you by the ear .
We will cooperate .
Remove the second TV .
There are many second TVs at work that don &apos;t create value , they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency .
You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don &apos;t cooperate .
The CEO of The Lego Group , Jorgen Vig Knudstorp , has a great way to use it .
He says , blame is not for failure , it is for failing to help or ask for help .
It changes everything .
Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses , my real forecast , because I know I will not be blamed if I fail , but if I fail to help or ask for help .
When you do this , it has a lot of implications on organizational design .
You stop drawing boxes , dotted lines , full lines ; you look at their interplay .
It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use .
On human resource management practices .
When you do that , you can manage complexity , the new complexity of business , without getting complicated .
You create more value with lower cost .
You simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both .
Complicatedness : This is your battle , business leaders .
The real battle is not against competitors .
This is rubbish , very abstract .
When do we meet competitors to fight them ?
The real battle is against ourselves , against our bureaucracy , our complicatedness .
Only you can fight , can do it .
Thank you .

Guy Hoffman : Robots with &quot; soul &quot;
What kind of robots does an animator / jazz musician / roboticist make ? Playful , reactive , curious ones . Guy Hoffman shows demo film of his family of unusual robots -- including two musical bots that like to jam with humans .
My job is to design , build and study robots that communicate with people .
But this story doesn &apos;t start with robotics at all , it starts with animation .
When I first saw Pixar &apos;s &quot; Luxo Jr . , &quot; I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp .
I mean , look at them -- at the end of this movie , you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture .
And I said , I have to learn how to do this .
So I made a really bad career decision .
And that &apos;s what my mom was like when I did it .
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation .
And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates .
I &apos;m not using this phrase metaphorically , the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room .
Whenever they did those news stories about building violations in New York , they would put the report in front of our building .
As kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are .
Anyway , during the day I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation .
And I learned two surprising lessons -- one of them was that when you want to arouse emotions , it doesn &apos;t matter so much how something looks , it &apos;s all in the motion -- it &apos;s in the timing of how the thing moves .
And the second , was something one of our teachers told us .
He actually did the weasel in Ice Age .
And he said : &quot; As an animator you are not a director , you &apos;re an actor . &quot;
So , if you want to find the right motion for a character , don &apos;t think about it , go use your body to find it -- stand in front of a mirror , act it out in front of a camera -- whatever you need .
And then put it back in your character .
A year later I found myself at MIT in the robotic life group , it was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots .
And I still had this dream to make an actual , physical Luxo Jr. lamp .
But I found that robots didn &apos;t move at all in this engaging way that I was used to for my animation studies .
Instead , they were all -- how should I put it , they were all kind of robotic .
And I thought , what if I took whatever I learned in animation school , and used that to design my robotic desk lamp .
So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible .
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop .
And I &apos;m actually redesigning the robot so , unbeknownst to itself , it &apos;s kind of digging its own grave by helping me .
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light , and more of a helpful , kind of quiet apprentice that &apos;s always there when you need it and doesn &apos;t really interfere .
And when , for example , I &apos;m looking for a battery that I can &apos;t find , in a subtle way , it will show me where the battery is .
So you can see my confusion here .
I &apos;m not an actor .
And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can at one point , just by the way it moves seem gentle and caring -- and in the other case , seem violent and confrontational .
And it &apos;s the same structure , just the motion is different .
Actor : &quot; You want to know something ? Well , you want to know something ?
He was already dead !
Just laying there , eyes glazed over ! &quot;
But , moving in graceful ways is just one building block of this whole structure called human-robot interaction .
I was at the time doing my Ph.D. , I was working on human robot teamwork ; teams of humans and robots working together .
I was studying the engineering , the psychology , the philosophy of teamwork .
And at the same time I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation with a good friend of mine who is actually here .
And in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us .
It was after a Passover seder .
We were folding up a lot of folding chairs , and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm .
Everybody did their own part .
We didn &apos;t have to divide our tasks .
We didn &apos;t have to communicate verbally about this .
It all just happened .
And I thought , humans and robots don &apos;t look at all like this .
When humans and robots interact , it &apos;s much more like a chess game .
The human does a thing , the robot analyzes whatever the human did , then the robot decides what to do next , plans it and does it .
And then the human waits , until it &apos;s their turn again .
So , it &apos;s much more like a chess game and that makes sense because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists .
It &apos;s all about information analysis , decision making and planning .
But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a doer that just clicks and works together .
So I made my second horrible career choice : I decided to study acting for a semester .
I took off from a Ph.D. I went to acting classes .
I actually participated in a play , I hope theres no video of that around still .
And I got every book I could find about acting , including one from the 19th century that I got from the library .
And I was really amazed because my name was the second name on the list -- the previous name was in 1889 . And this book was kind of waiting for 100 years to be rediscovered for robotics .
And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express .
But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting .
It became very popular in the 20th century .
And method acting said , you don &apos;t have to plan every muscle in your body .
Instead you have to use your body to find the right movement .
You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression .
Improvise , play off yor scene partner .
And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology called embodied cognition .
Which also talks about the same ideas -- We use our bodies to think , we don &apos;t just think with our brains and use our bodies to move .
but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave .
And it was like a lightning bolt .
I went back to my office .
I wrote this paper -- which I never really published called &quot; Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence . &quot;
And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together .
That &apos;s what you saw before with the actors .
And I thought : How can we make an artificial intelligence model -- computer , computational model -- that will model some of these ideas of improvisation , of taking risks , of taking chances , even of making mistakes .
Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates .
So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots .
Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence , to try to match my movements as closely as possible , sort of like a game .
Let &apos;s look at it .
You can see when I psych it out , it gets fooled .
And it &apos;s a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them .
And then , I did another experiment , and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp , and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence .
So , I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot .
The robot is the same lamp that you saw , and I put in it two brains .
For one half of the people , I put in a brain that &apos;s kind of the traditional , calculated robotic brain .
It waits for its turn , it analyzes everything , it plans .
Let &apos;s call it the calculated brain .
The other got more the stage actor , risk taker brain .
Let &apos;s call it the adventurous brain .
It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them .
And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes and they had to work together .
Somehow simulating like a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing .
And what I found was that people actually loved the adventurous robot .
And they thought it was more intelligent , more committed , a better member of the team , contributed to the success of the team more .
They even called it &apos; he &apos; and &apos; she , &apos; whereas people with the calculated brain called it &apos; it . &apos; And nobody ever called it &apos; he &apos; or &apos; she &apos; .
When they talked about it after the task with the adventurous brain , they said , &quot; By the end , we were good friends and high-fived mentally . &quot;
Whatever that means .
Sounds painful .
Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice .
It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more .
Which is almost what people expect robots to do , so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots , than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing .
And in a way , I thought , maybe it &apos;s time -- just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century , from going from the very calculated , planned way of behaving , to a more intuitive , risk-taking , embodied way of behaving .
Maybe it &apos;s time for robots to have the same kind of revolution .
A few years later , I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta , and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians .
And I thought , music , that &apos;s the perfect place to look at teamwork , coordination , timing , improvisation -- and we just got this robot playing marimba .
Marimba , for everybody who was like me , it was this huge , wooden xylophone .
And , when I was looking at this , I looked at other works in human-robot improvisation -- yes , there are other works in human-robot improvisation -- and they were also a little bit like a chess game .
The human would play , the robot would analyze what was played , would improvise their own part .
So , this is what musicians called a call and response interaction , and it also fits very well , robots and artificial intelligence .
But I thought , if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies , maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band .
Everybody &apos;s riffing off each other , nobody is stopping it for a moment .
And so , I tried to do the same things , this time with music , where the robot doesn &apos;t really know what it &apos;s about to play .
It just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play , And does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me .
She said , when you improvise , sometimes you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing and you &apos;re still doing it .
And so I tried to make a robot that doesn &apos;t actually know what it &apos;s doing , but it &apos;s still doing it .
So let &apos;s look at a few seconds from this performance .
Where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises .
And then , look at how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing , and picking up from its behavior .
And at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with .
Being a musician is not just about making notes , otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show .
Musicians also communicate with their bodies , with other band members , with the audience , they use their bodies to express the music .
And I thought , we already have a robot musician on stage , why not make it be a full-fledged musician .
And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot .
The head does &apos;t actually touch the marimba , it just expresses what the music is like .
These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta , that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home . So I spent , I would say on average , three to four hours a day there .
I think . And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like , but especially what a robotic musician would move like .
To sort of show that it doesn &apos;t like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it &apos;s feeling at the moment .
So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot , which was nice .
I &apos;m going to show you now the same kind of performance , this time with a socially expressive head .
And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it &apos;s picking up from the human .
We &apos;re also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it &apos;s doing .
And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo .
Now it &apos;s looking at me to make sure I &apos;m listening .
And now look at the final chord of the piece again , and this time the robot communicates with its body when it &apos;s busy doing its own thing .
And when it &apos;s ready to coordinate the final chord with me .
Thanks . I hope you see how much this totally not -- how much this part of the body that doesn &apos;t touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance .
And at some point , we are in Atlanta , so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point .
And we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot .
And here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat and -- notice two things . One , how irresistible it is to join the robot while it &apos;s moving its head .
and you kind of want to move your own head when it does it .
And second , even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone , as soon as the robot turns to him , he turns back .
So even though it &apos;s just in the periphery of his vision -- it &apos;s just in the corner of his eye -- it &apos;s very powerful .
And the reason is that we can &apos;t ignore physical things moving in our environment .
We are wired for that .
So , if you have a problem with maybe your partners looking at the iPhone too much or their smartphone too much , you might want to have a robot there to get their attention . Just to introduce the last robot that we &apos;ve worked on , that came out of something kind of surprising that we found : At some point people didn &apos;t care anymore about the robot being so intelligent , and can improvise and listen , and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years on developing .
They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music . And they didn &apos;t say that the robot was moving to the music , they said that the robot was enjoying the music .
And we thought , why don &apos;t we take this idea , and I designed a new piece of furniture .
This time it wasn &apos;t a desk lamp ; it was a speaker dock .
It was one of those things you plug your smartphone in .
And I thought , what would happen if your speaker dock didn &apos;t just play the music for you , but it would actually enjoy it too . And so again , here are some animation tests from an early stage . And this is what the final product looked like .
So , a lot of bobbing head .
A lot of bobbing heads in the audience , so we can still see robots influence people .
And it &apos;s not just fun and games .
I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move -- and I &apos;m going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding -- is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in their life .
Somewhere in your future there &apos;s going to be a robot in your life .
And if not in yours , then in your children &apos;s lives .
And I want these robots to be -- to be more fluent , more engaging , more graceful than currently they seem to be .
And for that I think that maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians .
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise .
And maybe they should be able to anticipate what you &apos;re about to do .
And maybe they need to be able to make mistakes and correct them , because in the end we are human .
And maybe as humans , robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us .
Thank you .

Sheryl Sandberg : So we leaned in ... now what ?
Sheryl Sandberg admits she was terrified to step onto the TED stage in 2010 -- because she was going to talk , for the first time , about the lonely experience of being a woman in the top tiers of business . Millions of views later , the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk , Pat Mitchell . Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea , and explores the ways that women still struggle with success .
Pat Mitchell : Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage .
Sheryl Sandberg : First time back . Nice to see everyone . It &apos;s always so nice to look out and see so many women .
It &apos;s so not my regular experience , as I know anyone else &apos;s .
PM : So when we first started talking about , maybe the subject wouldn &apos;t be social media , which we assumed it would be , but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions , particularly in the sector of technology and social media .
But how did that evolve for you as a thought , and end up being the TED Talk that you gave ?
SS : So I was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women , because I grew up in the business world , as I think so many of us did .
You never talk about being a woman , because someone might notice that you &apos;re a woman , right ?
They might notice . Or worse , if you say &quot; woman , &quot; people on the other end of the table think you &apos;re asking for special treatment , or complaining .
Or worse , about to sue them . And so I went through -- Right ? I went through my entire business career , and never spoke about being a woman , never spoke about it publicly .
But I also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
I came out of college over 20 years ago , and I thought that all of my peers were men and women , all the people above me were all men , but that would change , because your generation had done such an amazing job fighting for equality , equality was now ours for the taking . And it wasn &apos;t .
Because year after year , I was one of fewer and fewer , and now , often the only woman in a room .
And I talked to a bunch of people about , should I give a speech at TEDWomen about women , and they said , oh no , no .
It will end your business career . You cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman . You &apos;ll never be taken seriously again .
But fortunately , there were the few , the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech , and I asked myself the question Mark Zuckerberg might -- the founder of Facebook and my boss -- asks all of us , which is , what would I do if I wasn &apos;t afraid ?
And the answer to what would I do if I wasn &apos;t afraid is I would get on the TED stage , and talk about women , and leadership . And I did , and survived . PM : I would say , not only survived . I &apos;m thinking of that moment , Sheryl , when you and I were standing backstage together , and you turned to me , and you told me a story .
And I said -- very last minute -- you know , you really should share that story .
SS : Oh , yeah . PM : What was that story ?
SS : Well , it &apos;s an important part of the journey . So I had -- TEDWomen -- the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here , so I had gotten on a plane the day before , and my daughter was three , she was clinging to my leg : &quot; Mommy , don &apos;t go . &quot;
And Pat &apos;s a friend , and so , not related to the speech I was planning on giving , which was chock full of facts and figures , and nothing personal , I told Pat the story . I said , well , I &apos;m having a hard day .
Yesterday my daughter was clinging to my leg , and &quot; Don &apos;t go . &quot;
And you looked at me and said , you have to tell that story .
I said , on the TED stage ? Are you kidding ?
I &apos;m going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg ?
And you said yes , because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles , you have to be honest about how hard it is .
And I did . And I think that &apos;s a really important part of the journey .
The same thing happened when I wrote my book . I started writing the book . I wrote a first chapter , I thought it was fabulous . It was chock-full of data and figures , I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai tribes , and their sociological patterns .
My husband read it and he was like , this is like eating your Wheaties . No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there &apos;s someone -- no one , no one will read this book .
And I realized through the process that I had to be more honest and more open , and I had to tell my stories . My stories of still not feeling as self-confident as I should , in many situations . My first and failed marriage . Crying at work .
Felling like I didn &apos;t belong there , feeling guilty to this day .
And part of my journey , starting on this stage , going to &quot; Lean In , &quot; going to the foundation , is all about being more open and honest about those challenges , so that other women can be more open and honest , and all of us can work together towards real equality .
PM : I think that one of the most striking parts about the book , and in my opinion , one of the reasons it &apos;s hit such a nerve and is resonating around the world , is that you are personal in the book , and that you do make it clear that , while you &apos;ve observed some things that are very important for other women to know , that you &apos;ve had the same challenges that many others of us have , as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and possibly the people who don &apos;t believe the same .
So talk about that process : deciding you &apos;d go public with the private part , and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges .
SS : After I did the TED Talk , what happened was -- you know , I never really expected to write a book , I &apos;m not an author , I &apos;m not a writer , and it was viewed a lot , and it really started impacting people &apos;s lives .
I got this great --- one of the first letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work , and she turned it down , and she told her best friend she turned it down , and her best friend said , you really need to watch this TED Talk .
And so she watched this TED Talk , and she went back the next day , she took the job , she went home , and she handed her husband the grocery list . And she said , I can do this .
And what really mattered to me -- it wasn &apos;t only women in the corporate world , even though I did hear from a lot of them , and it did impact a lot of them , it was also people of all different circumstances .
There was a doctor I met who was an attending physician at Johns Hopkins , and he said that until he saw my TED Talk , it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in his med school classes were women , they weren &apos;t speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds .
So he started paying attention , and as he waited for raised hands , he realized the men &apos;s hands were up .
So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more , and it still didn &apos;t work .
So he told everyone , no more hand raising , I &apos;m cold-calling .
So he could call evenly on men and women . And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better , and he was able to go back to them and tell them that .
And then there was the woman , stay-at-home mom , lives in a really difficult neighborhood , with not a great school , she said that TED Talk -- she &apos;s never had a corporate job , but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher for her child .
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice .
And I realized that other women and men could find their voice through it , which is why I went from the talk to the book .
PM : And in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you &apos;ve learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a -- you became a sort of expert in how you lean in .
So what did that feel like , and become like in your life ?
To launch not just a book , not just a best-selling , best-viewed talk , but a movement , where people began to literally describe their actions at work as , I &apos;m leaning in .
SS : I mean , I &apos;m grateful , I &apos;m honored , I &apos;m happy , and it &apos;s the very beginning .
So I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m an expert , or if anyone is an expert . I certainly have done a lot of research .
I have read every study , I have pored over the materials , and the lessons are very clear . Because here &apos;s what we know : What we know is that stereotypes are holding women back from leadership roles all over the world .
It &apos;s so striking . &quot; Lean In &quot; is very global , I &apos;ve been all over the world , talking about it , and -- cultures are so different .
Even within our own country , to Japan , to Korea , to China , to Asia , Europe , they &apos;re so different . Except for one thing : gender .
All over the world , no matter what our cultures are , we think men should be strong , assertive , aggressive , have voice ; we think women should speak when spoken to , help others .
Now we have , all over the world , women are called &quot; bossy . &quot; There is a word for &quot; bossy , &quot; for little girls , in every language there &apos;s one .
It &apos;s a word that &apos;s pretty much not used for little boys , because if a little boy leads , there &apos;s no negative word for it , it &apos;s expected . But if a little girl leads , she &apos;s bossy .
Now I know there aren &apos;t a lot of men here , but bear with me .
If you &apos;re a man , you &apos;ll have to represent your gender .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;ve been told you &apos;re too aggressive at work .
There &apos;s always a few , it runs about five percent . Okay , get ready , gentlemen .
If you &apos;re a woman , please raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever been told you &apos;re too aggressive at work .
That is what audiences have said in every country in the world , and it &apos;s deeply supported by the data .
Now , do we think women are more aggressive than men ? Of course not .
It &apos;s just that we judge them through a different lens , and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work , to get results , to lead , are ones that we think , in a man , he &apos;s a boss , and in a woman , she &apos;s bossy .
And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it .
One of the happiest moments I had in this whole journey is , after the book came out , I stood on a stage with John Chambers , the CEO of Cisco .
He read the book . He stood on a stage with me , he invited me in front of his whole management team , men and women , and he said , I thought we were good at this . I thought I was good at this .
And then I read this book , and I realized that we -- my company -- we have called all of our senior women too aggressive , and I &apos;m standing on this stage , and I &apos;m sorry .
And I want you to know we &apos;re never going to do it again .
PM : Can we send that to a lot of other people that we know ? SS : And so John is doing that because he believes it &apos;s good for his company , and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it .
And so next time you all see someone call a little girl &quot; bossy , &quot; you walk right up to that person , big smile , and you say , &quot; That little girl &apos;s not bossy . That little girl has executive leadership skills . &quot; PM : I know that &apos;s what you &apos;re telling your daughter . SS : Absolutely .
PM : And you did focus in the book -- and the reason , as you said , in writing it , was to create a dialogue about this .
I mean , let &apos;s just put it out there , face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors , and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions .
So in the months that have come since the book , in which &quot; Lean In &quot; focused on that and said , here are some of the challenges that remain , and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves . What has changed ?
Have you seen changes ?
SS : Well , there &apos;s certainly more dialogue , which is great .
But what really matters to me , and I think all of us , is action .
So everywhere I go , CEOs , they &apos;re mostly men , say to me , you &apos;re costing me so much money because all the women want to be paid as much as the men .
And to them I say , I &apos;m not sorry at all . At all . I mean , the women should be paid as much as the men .
Everywhere I go , women tell me they ask for raises .
Everywhere I go , women say they &apos;re getting better relationships with their spouses , asking for more help at home , asking for the promotions they should be getting at work , and importantly , believing it themselves . Even little things .
One of the governors of one of the states told me that he didn &apos;t realize that more women were , in fact , literally sitting on the side of the room , which they are , and now he made a rule that all the women on his staff need to sit at the table .
The foundation I started along with the book &quot; Lean In &quot; helps women , or men , start circles -- small groups , it can be 10 , it can be however many you want , which meet once a month .
I would have hoped that by now , we &apos;d have about 500 circles . That would &apos;ve been great .
You know , 500 times roughly 10 .
There are over 12,000 circles in 50 countries in the world .
PM : Wow , that &apos;s amazing .
SS : And these are people who are meeting every single month .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
A group of women , they &apos;re all about 29 or 30 , they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing , several of them grew up in very poor , rural China .
These women are 29 , they are told by their society that they are &quot; left over , &quot; because they are not yet married , and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves .
What they want in their careers . The kind of partners they want , if at all .
I looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they &apos;re from , and I said , I &apos;m Sheryl Sandberg , and this was my dream .
And I kind of just started crying .
Right , which , I admit , I do . Right ? I &apos;ve talked about it before .
But the fact that a woman so far away out in the world , who grew up in a rural village , who &apos;s being told to marry someone she doesn &apos;t want to marry , can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that , and find life on her own terms .
That &apos;s the kind of change we have to hope for .
PM : Have you been surprised by the global nature of the message ?
Because I think when the book first came out , many people thought , well , this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up .
They need to look at this , anticipate the barriers , and recognize them , put them out in the open , have the dialogue about it , but that it &apos;s really for women who are that . Doing that . Pursuing the corporate world .
And yet the book is being read , as you say , in rural and developing countries .
What part of that has surprised you , and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ?
SS : The book is about self-confidence , and about equality .
And it turns out , everywhere in the world , women need more self-confidence , because the world tells us we &apos;re not equal to men .
Everywhere in the world , we live in a world where the men get &quot; and , &quot; and women get &quot; or . &quot;
I &apos;ve never met a man who &apos;s been asked how he does it all . Again , I &apos;m going to turn to the men in the audience : Please raise your hand if you &apos;ve been asked , how do you do it all ?
Men only .
Women , women . Please raise your hand if you &apos;ve been asked how you do it all ?
We assume men can do it all , slash -- have jobs and children .
We assume women can &apos;t , and that &apos;s ridiculous , because the great majority of women everywhere in the world , including the United States , work full time and have children .
And I think people don &apos;t fully understand how broad the message is .
There is a circle that &apos;s been started for rescued sex workers in Miami .
They &apos;re using &quot; Lean In &quot; to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life , really rescuing them from their pimps , and using it .
There are dress-for-success groups in Texas which are using the book , for women who have never been to college .
And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia .
And so these messages of equality -- of how women are told they can &apos;t have what men can have -- how we assume that leadership is for men , how we assume that voice is for men , these affect all of us , and I think they are very universal .
And it &apos;s part of what TEDWomen does .
It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in , which is more women , more voice , more equality .
PM : If you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk , what would you say that is a result of this experience , for you personally , and what you &apos;ve learned about women , and men , as you &apos;ve made this journey ?
SS : I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly , but I think I can say it more strongly -- I want to say that the status quo is not enough .
That it &apos;s not good enough , that it &apos;s not changing quickly enough .
Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book , another year of data came out from the U.S. Census .
And you know what we found ?
No movement in the wage gap for women in the United States .
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar .
If you are a black woman , 64 cents .
If you are a Latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
Do you know when the last time those numbers went up ?
2002 .
We are stagnating , we are stagnating in so many ways .
And I think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . It &apos;s so hard to talk about gender .
We shy away from the word &quot; feminist , &quot; a word I really think we need to embrace .
We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back -- I think I would say in a louder voice , we need to get rid of the word &quot; bossy &quot; and bring back the word &quot; feminist , &quot; because we need it .
PM : And we all need to do a lot more leaning in .
SS : A lot more leaning in .
PM : Thank you , Sheryl .
Thanks for leaning in and saying yes .
SS : Thank you .

Suzanne Talhouk : Don &apos;t kill your language
More and more , English is a global language ; speaking it is perceived as a sign of being modern . But -- what do we lose when we leave behind our mother tongues ? Suzanne Talhouk makes an impassioned case to love your own language , and to cherish what it can express that no other language can . In Arabic with subtitles .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ? &quot;
He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
He said , &quot; Sorry ? . &quot;
I said , &quot; The menu , please . &quot;
He replied , &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; menu &quot; , or &quot; menu &quot; . &quot;
Is the French pronunciation correct ?
&quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; said the waiter .
He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; menu &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me mad . It definitely hurts !
I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Where could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
How ?
Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know better than them ?
we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; what does this remind you of ?
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
Regardless of the who , how and why .
Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intellect ?
How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
So , if I say , &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom slogan ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
She said , &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot;
The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; toqborni , &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
Does she want to commit suicide ?
&apos;Bury me ? &apos; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot;
The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you -- &quot; And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot;
Translate that for me .
So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
Even though many people told me , &quot; Why do you bother ?
Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot;
No problem !
The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot;
We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say-- We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
So , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; has hit the spot .
Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; written on it .
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
Photos of &quot; cool &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to whoever might say , &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot;
I say , &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
I will keep on saying &quot; Internet &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
Creativity is the idea .
So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identifies its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; This is your father , honey . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot;
And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; Thanks , &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe .

Diana Nyad : Never , ever give up
In the pitch-black night , stung by jellyfish , choking on salt water , singing to herself , hallucinating … Diana Nyad just kept on swimming . And that &apos;s how she finally achieved her lifetime goal as an athlete : an extreme 100-mile swim from Cuba to Florida -- at age 64 . Hear her story .
It &apos;s the fifth time I stand on this shore , the Cuban shore , looking out at that distant horizon , believing , again , that I &apos;m going to make it all the way across that vast , dangerous wilderness of an ocean .
Not only have I tried four times , but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950 , and it &apos;s still never been done .
The team is proud of our four attempts .
It &apos;s an expedition of some 30 people .
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler , who somehow summons will , that last drop of will within me , when I think it &apos;s gone , after many , many hours and days out there .
The shark experts are the best in the world -- large predators below .
The box jellyfish , the deadliest venom in all of the ocean , is in these waters , and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt .
The conditions themselves , besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean -- the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself , the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth .
And by the way , it &apos;s amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me , &quot; Well , are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything ? &quot;
And I &apos;m thinking , what are they imagining ?
That I &apos;ll just sort of do some celestial navigation , and carry a bowie knife in my mouth , and I &apos;ll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them , and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water .
Yes , I have a team . And the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedition on the planet .
And we &apos;ve been on a journey .
And the debate has raged , hasn &apos;t it , since the Greeks , of isn &apos;t it what it &apos;s all about ?
Isn &apos;t life about the journey , not really the destination ?
And here we &apos;ve been on this journey , and the truth is , it &apos;s been thrilling .
We haven &apos;t reached that other shore , and still our sense of pride and commitment , unwavering commitment .
When I turned 60 , the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s , and dreamed it and imagined it .
The most famous body of water on the Earth today , I imagine , Cuba to Florida .
And it was deep . It was deep in my soul .
And when I turned 60 , it wasn &apos;t so much about the athletic accomplishment , it wasn &apos;t the ego of &quot; I want to be the first . &quot;
That &apos;s always there and it &apos;s undeniable .
But it was deeper . It was , how much life is there left ?
Let &apos;s face it , we &apos;re all on a one-way street , aren &apos;t we , and what are we going to do ?
What are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back ?
And all this past year in training , I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it , floating around in my brain , and it says , &quot; You go ahead , you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic , you be the observer , while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again , but yet isn &apos;t afraid and isn &apos;t timid and lives life in a bold way . &quot;
And so of course I want to make it across .
It is the goal , and I should be so shallow to say that this year , the destination was even sweeter than the journey .
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking .
And at this point , by this summer , everybody -- scientists , sports scientists , endurance experts , neurologists , my own team , Bonnie -- said it &apos;s impossible .
It just simply can &apos;t be done , and Bonnie said to me , &quot; But if you &apos;re going to take the journey , I &apos;m going to see you through to the end of it , so I &apos;ll be there . &quot;
And now we &apos;re there .
And as we &apos;re looking out , kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke , standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway , the Cuban flag is flying above , all my team &apos;s out in their boats , hands up in the air , &quot; We &apos;re here , we &apos;re here for you , &quot; Bonnie and I look at each other , and we say , this year , the mantra is -- and I &apos;ve been using it in training -- find a way .
You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you , as we all do .
None of us ever get through this life without heartache , without turmoil , and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality , you find your way , and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders , and she said , &quot; Let &apos;s find our way to Florida . &quot;
And we started , and for the next 53 hours , it was an intense , unforgettable life experience .
The highs were high , the awe , I &apos;m not a religious person , but I &apos;ll tell you , to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if , as you &apos;re breathing , you &apos;re looking down miles and miles and miles , to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on , it &apos;s awe-inspiring .
I have a playlist of about 85 songs , and especially in the middle of the night , and that night , because we use no lights -- lights attract jellyfish , lights attract sharks , lights attract baitfish that attract sharks , so we go in the pitch black of the night .
You &apos;ve never seen black this black .
You can &apos;t see the front of your hand , Bonnie and my team on the boat , they just hear the slapping of the arms , and they know where I am , because there &apos;s no visual at all .
And I &apos;m out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist .
I &apos;ve got a tight rubber cap , so I don &apos;t hear a thing .
I &apos;ve got goggles and I &apos;m turning my head 50 times a minute , and I &apos;m singing , Imagine there &apos;s no heaven doo doo doo doo doo It &apos;s easy if you try doo doo doo doo doo And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row .
Now there &apos;s a talent unto itself .
And each time I get done with Ooh , you may say I &apos;m a dreamer but I &apos;m not the only one 222 .
Imagine there &apos;s no heaven And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon &apos;s &quot; Imagine , &quot; I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes , exactly .
And then there are the crises . Of course there are .
And the vomiting starts , the seawater , you &apos;re not well , you &apos;re wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection .
It &apos;s difficult to swim in .
It &apos;s causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth , but the tentacles can &apos;t get you .
And the hypothermia sets in .
The water &apos;s 85 degrees , and yet you &apos;re losing weight and using calories , and as you come over toward the side of the boat , not allowed to touch it , not allowed to get out , but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I &apos;m doing , am I all right , I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here .
I &apos;m in a very different state , and I &apos;m thinking , wow , I never thought I &apos;d be running into the Taj Mahal out here .
It &apos;s gorgeous .
I mean , how long did it take them to build that ?
It &apos;s just -- So , uh , wooo . And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
What &apos;s going to happen to you between this point and that point ?
What &apos;s going to happen to the weather and the currents and , God forbid , you &apos;re stung when you don &apos;t think you could be stung in all this armor , and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said , &quot; Come here , &quot; and I came close to the boat , and she said , &quot; Look , look out there , &quot; and I saw light , because the day &apos;s easier than the night , and I thought we were coming into day , and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s going to be morning soon . &quot;
And she said , &quot; No , those are the lights of Key West . &quot;
It was 15 more hours , which for most swimmers would be a long time .
You have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done .
So here we go , and I somehow , without a decision , went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe , I just went into thinking about this dream , and why , and how .
And as I said , when I turned 60 , it wasn &apos;t about that concrete &quot; Can you do it ? &quot;
That &apos;s the everyday machinations .
That &apos;s the discipline , and it &apos;s the preparation , and there &apos;s a pride in that .
But I decided to think , as I went along , about , the phrase usually is reaching for the stars , and in my case , it &apos;s reaching for the horizon .
And when you reach for the horizon , as I &apos;ve proven , you may not get there , but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down .
What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons .
And now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
The epic journey is going to be over .
So many people come up to me now and say , &quot; What &apos;s next ? We love that !
That little tracker that was on the computer ?
When are you going to do the next one ? We just can &apos;t wait to follow the next one . &quot;
Well , they were just there for 53 hours , and I was there for years .
And so there won &apos;t be another epic journey in the ocean .
But the point is , and the point was that every day of our lives is epic , and I &apos;ll tell you , when I walked up onto that beach , staggered up onto that beach , and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way , rehearsed what I would say on the beach .
When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up , and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she &apos;s really beginning to have trouble breathing .
Another 12 , 24 hours in the saltwater , the whole thing -- and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment , that I heard the word tracheotomy .
And Bonnie said to the doctor , &quot; I &apos;m not worried about her not breathing .
If she can &apos;t talk when she gets to the shore , she &apos;s gonna be pissed off . &quot;
But the truth is , all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation , it wasn &apos;t like that .
It was a very real moment , with that crowd , with my team .
We did it . I didn &apos;t do it . We did it .
And we &apos;ll never forget it . It &apos;ll always be part of us .
And the three things that I did sort of blurt out when we got there , was first , &quot; Never , ever give up . &quot;
I live it . What &apos;s the phrase from today from Socrates ?
To be is to do .
So I don &apos;t stand up and say , don &apos;t ever give up .
I didn &apos;t give up , and there was action behind these words .
The second is , &quot; You can chase your dreams at any age ; you &apos;re never too old . &quot;
Sixty-four , that no one at any age , any gender , could ever do , has done it , and there &apos;s no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today .
Yeah .
Thank you .
And the third thing I said on that beach was , &quot; It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world , and in other ways , and the most important ways , it &apos;s a team , and if you think I &apos;m a badass , you want to meet Bonnie . &quot;
Bonnie , where are you ?
Where are you ?
There &apos;s Bonnie Stoll . My buddy .
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes , when you achieve your dreams , it &apos;s not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them .
And yeah , I stand before you now .
In the three months since that swim ended , I &apos;ve sat down with Oprah and I &apos;ve been in President Obama &apos;s Oval Office .
I &apos;ve been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves .
I &apos;ve signed a wonderful major book contract .
All of that &apos;s great , and I don &apos;t denigrate it .
I &apos;m proud of it all , but the truth is , I &apos;m walking around tall because I am that bold , fearless person , and I will be , every day , until it &apos;s time for these days to be done .
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Find a way !
Boyd Varty : What I learned from Nelson Mandela
&quot; In the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us . &quot; Boyd Varty , a wildlife activist , shares stories of animals , humans and their interrelatedness , or &quot; ubuntu &quot; -- defined as , &quot; I am , because of you . &quot; And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela , the human embodiment of that same great-hearted , generous spirit .
I &apos;m a man who &apos;s trying to live from his heart , and so just before I get going , I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
And so this talk is going to be for him .
I grew up in wonder .
I grew up amongst those animals .
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve .
It &apos;s a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations .
Now for as long as I can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so I think it &apos;s a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
Now my stories are not the stories that you &apos;ll hear on the news , and while it &apos;s true that Africa is a harsh place , I also know it to be a place where people , animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world .
When I was nine years old , President Mandela came to stay with my family .
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye , and it &apos;s true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi .
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
I would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
At night , I would sit with my family around the snowy , bunny-eared TV , and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly .
He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa , one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity .
Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
Through this act of immense open-heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call &quot; ubuntu . &quot;
Ubuntu : I am because of you .
Or , people are not people without other people .
It &apos;s not a new idea or value but it &apos;s one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on .
In fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am .
Without you , I &apos;m just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it &apos;s not the same as this .
If Mandela was the national and international embodiment , then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man , Solly Mhlongo .
Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique .
He would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
Solly grew up tending to his father &apos;s cattle .
Now , I can tell you , I don &apos;t know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for über-resourcefulness .
The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks .
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea , but he could do it .
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
He fixed roads , he mended wetlands , he did some anti-poaching .
And then one day we were out together , and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked .
And it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and I tell you , I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker .
If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you &apos;d see he &apos;d stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , &quot; Solly , you are pathologically helpful . &quot;
When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment , Solly was my tracker .
We worked together as a team .
And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast , and they said to Solly , on the side , they said , &quot; Before we even go out to see lions and leopards , we want to see where you live . &quot;
So we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly &apos;s wife , who was learning English , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , &quot; Hello , I love you .
Welcome , I love you . &quot; And there was something so beautifully African about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
Now on the day that Solly saved my life , he was already my hero .
It was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
Because of the heat , I took my shoes off , and I rolled up my pants , and I walked into the water .
Solly remained on the bank .
The water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
And a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
And if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; Don &apos;t go in there . Don &apos;t go in there . &quot; And of course , the crocodile was in the shadows .
Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite .
Wham ! It hits me by my right leg .
It pulls me . It turns . I throw my hand up . I &apos;m able to grab a branch .
It &apos;s shaking me violently .
It &apos;s a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you , and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that .
Solly on the bank sees that I &apos;m in trouble .
He turns . He begins to make his way to me .
The croc again continues to shake me .
It goes to bite me a second time .
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream .
As it bites the second time , I kick .
My foot goes down its throat . It spits me out .
I pull myself up into the branches , and as I come out of the water , I look over my shoulder .
My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
The bone is cracked .
The meat is torn up .
I make an instant decision that I &apos;ll never look at that again .
As I come out of the water , Solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
He knows , he sees the state of my leg , he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile , and I can tell you this man doesn &apos;t slow down for one second .
He comes straight into the channel .
He wades in to above his waist .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
I &apos;m still in a vulnerable position .
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
This is the other thing about Solly , he &apos;s freakishly strong .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He lays me down . He pulls his shirt off .
He wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
And I survive .
Now — Now I don &apos;t know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for Solly , it was as natural as breathing .
And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa .
In a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
Danger is shared . Pain is shared .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Houses are shared . Food is shared .
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share , and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value , his animated , empathetic action in every moment .
Now although the root word is about people , I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people .
And then I met this young lady .
Her name was Elvis .
In fact , Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance .
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route .
When I first saw her , I thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
And yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track .
It looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her , it was this sense of kinship .
And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving .
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
It was sort of a hollow in the ground .
And I watched as the matriarch drank , and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants , looks like the arm in motion , and she began to make her way up the steep bank .
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill .
She got visibly -- ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
She attempted it a second time , and again , halfway up , she fell backwards .
And on the third attempt , an amazing thing happened .
Halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant .
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
If Africa has a gift to share , it &apos;s a gift of a more collective society .
And while it &apos;s true that ubuntu is an African idea , what I see is the essence of that value being invented here .
Thank you .
Pat Mitchell : So Boyd , we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today , and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world .
But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
Boyd Varty : Well thanks , Pat .
I &apos;m so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
He was suffering .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about .
And she was like , &quot; Well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot;
I mean , that &apos;s just incredible humility .
He was the father of our nation and we &apos;ve got a road to walk in South Africa .
And everything , they used to call it Madiba magic .
You know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
Anywhere he went , things went well .
But I think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to try and do , and that &apos;s what people all over South Africa are trying to do .
PM : And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . BV : Oh , thank you .
PM : Thank you . BV : Thank you . Thanks very much .

Dambisa Moyo : Is China the new idol for emerging economies ?
The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism , democracy and political rights for all . Those in emerging markets often don &apos;t have that luxury . In this powerful talk , economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can &apos;t afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow . Instead , a different model , embodied by China , is increasingly appealing . A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
When Patrick Henry , the governor of Virginia , said these words in 1775 , he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come .
At the time , these words were earmarked and targeted against the British , but over the last 200 years , they &apos;ve come to embody what many Westerners believe , that freedom is the most cherished value , and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them .
Who could blame them ?
Over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development .
In the United States over the past hundred years , incomes have increased 30 times , and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty .
Meanwhile , American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
It &apos;s no surprise , then , that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis , President Obama said , &quot; The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill .
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched . &quot;
Thus , there &apos;s understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth , liberal democracy , and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights .
However , to many who live in the emerging markets , this is an illusion , and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was signed in 1948 , was unanimously adopted , what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries , and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights .
This schism has only grown wider .
Today , many people who live in the emerging markets , where 90 percent of the world &apos;s population lives , believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point , and what is actually important is delivering on food , shelter , education and healthcare .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy .
Now , I know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; Well actually , this is hard to grasp , &quot; because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct .
But I ask you today , what would you do if you had to choose ?
What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote ?
Over the last 10 years , I &apos;ve had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries , many of them in the emerging markets , in Latin America , Asia , and my own continent of Africa .
I &apos;ve met with presidents , dissidents , policymakers , lawyers , teachers , doctors and the man on the street , and through these conversations , it &apos;s become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there &apos;s actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not saying people in the emerging markets don &apos;t understand democracy , nor am I saying that they wouldn &apos;t ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders .
Of course they would .
However , I am saying that on balance , they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from , and how it is their governments can deliver for them , than whether or not the government was elected by democracy .
The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by China .
And rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
Instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time .
If you will indulge me , I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they &apos;ve come to this belief .
First of all , it &apos;s China &apos;s economic performance over the past 30 years .
She &apos;s been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
It &apos;s not just in economics , but it &apos;s also in terms of living standards .
We see that in China , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
Today , it &apos;s closer to 82 percent .
So in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
Second , China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct .
Today , the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world .
They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems , one with private capitalism , another one broadly with state capitalism .
However , these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient , which is a measure of income equality .
Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China &apos;s income equality has been improving in recent times , whereas that of the United States has been declining .
Thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at China &apos;s amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country -- she &apos;s been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States -- but even if you look to places like Africa , China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo , which is 9,000 miles , or three times the distance of New York to California .
Now this is something that people can see and point to .
Perhaps it &apos;s no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey , when surveyed , Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
Finally , China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces .
If you travel to Mogadishu , Mexico City or Mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
However , through a network of state-owned enterprises , the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas , using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions .
Ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s no surprise that around the world , people are pointing at what China is doing and saying , &quot; I like that . I want that .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
That is the system that seems to work . &quot;
I &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance .
In particular , there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth .
In fact , countries like Taiwan , Singapore , Chile , not just China , have shown that actually , it &apos;s economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy .
In a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year , your democracy will last about eight and a half years .
If your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year , then you &apos;re likely to only get 33 years of democracy .
And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water .
What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable .
But perhaps it &apos;s also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy , because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies , democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world &apos;s countries today are democratic , 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don &apos;t have free speech or freedom of movement .
But also , we &apos;re finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years .
What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we &apos;ve got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen .
What might that world look like ?
Well , the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism ; greater protectionisms of nation-states ; but also , as I just pointed out a moment ago , ever-declining political rights and individual rights .
The question that is left for us in general is , what then should the West be doing ?
And I suggest that they have two options .
The West can either compete or cooperate .
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model , and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy , this is basically going against headwinds , but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy , and state capitalism .
Now the fact of the matter is , if the West decides to compete , it will create a wider schism .
The other option is for the West to cooperate , and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them .
Now I &apos;m sure some of you in the room will be thinking , well , this is like ceding to China , and this is a way , in other words , for the West to take a back seat .
that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential , they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want .
instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China , the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior , the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world , perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today .
Indeed , the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States .
Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
In fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
At its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
It &apos;s the model that put food on the table .
It &apos;s the refrigerators .
It put a man on the moon .
But the fact of the matter is , although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say , &quot; I want that , I like that , &quot; there &apos;s now a new person in town in the form of a country , China .
Today , generations are looking at China and saying , &quot; China can produce infrastructure , China can produce economic growth , and we like that . &quot;
Because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way , to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time .
As you leave here today , I would like to leave you with a very personal message , which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals , and this is really about being open-minded , open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world , creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people , has to be based in being open-minded , because these systems have good things and they have bad things .
Just to illustrate , I went into my annals of myself .
That &apos;s a picture of me .
Awww . I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969 .
At the time of my birth , blacks were not issued birth certificates , and that law only changed in 1973 .
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government .
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , I &apos;ve gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views .
In this vein , we can increase economic growth .
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
But also , it &apos;s going to require that we look at our assumptions , assumptions and strictures that we &apos;ve grown up with around democracy , around private capitalism , around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms .
We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth .
Ultimately , it &apos;s about transforming the world and making it a better place .
Thank you very much .

Abha Dawesar : Life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
One year ago , Abha Dawesar was living in blacked-out Manhattan post-Sandy , scrounging for power to connect . As a novelist , she was struck by this metaphor : Have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect , while we miss out on what &apos;s real ?
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy , and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me .
Half the city was dark because of a power cut , and I was living on the dark side .
Now , Maui was terrified of the dark , so I had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day .
And through all of this , I had to hold a torch between my teeth .
The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread .
For a shower , I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym .
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day .
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices .
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .
I wasn &apos;t the only one .
Even in the rain , people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street .
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology , and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
I think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell you what &apos;s really important and what &apos;s not , and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
The self as we once knew it no longer exists , and I think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and I want to talk to you about what I think that means .
I &apos;m a novelist , and I &apos;m interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
They &apos;re both stories , interpretations .
You and I can experience things without a story .
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless .
But the larger sense that we have of our lives , the slightly more abstract one , is indirect .
Our story of our life is based on direct experience , but it &apos;s embellished .
A novel needs scene after scene to build , and the story of our life needs an arc as well .
It needs months and years .
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
But the story is not about these chapters .
It &apos;s the whole book .
It &apos;s not only about the heartbreak and the happiness , the victories and the disappointments , but it &apos;s because how because of these , and sometimes , more importantly , in spite of these , we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves .
Our story , therefore , needs two dimensions of time : a long arc of time that is our lifespan , and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment .
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment , but the one that narrates needs several moments , a whole sequence of them , and that &apos;s why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time .
Now , the flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a grain of sand , in the budding of a little bud into a rose .
Without it , we would have no music .
Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time , regret or nostalgia about the past , hope or dread about the future .
I think that technology has altered that flow of time .
The overall time that we have for our narrative , our lifespan , has been increasing , but the smallest measure , the moment , has shrunk .
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
Science can do things with and in a picosecond , but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second .
You and I answer only to nature &apos;s rhythm and flow , to the sun , the moon and the seasons , and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past , the present and the future to see things for what they are , to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations .
We need time &apos;s arrow to understand cause and effect , not just in the material world , but in our own intentions and our motivations .
What happens when that arrow goes awry ?
What happens when time warps ?
So many of us today have the sensation that time &apos;s arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once .
This is because time doesn &apos;t flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time .
Far away over there is now here .
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I &apos;m in New York or New Delhi .
And that &apos;s not all .
Your last job , your dinner reservations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today &apos;s friends , because the Internet also archives , and it warps the past .
With no distinction left between the past , the present and the future , and the here or there , we are left with this moment everywhere , this moment that I &apos;ll call the digital now .
Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now ?
This digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
This isn &apos;t the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book .
This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state .
Its focus , instead , is to distract us at every turn on the road .
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else .
Are you reading an interview by an author ?
Why not buy his book ? Tweet it . Share it .
Like it . Find other books exactly like his .
Find other people reading those books .
Travel can be liberating , but when it is incessant , we become permanent exiles without repose .
Choice is freedom , but not when it &apos;s constantly for its own sake .
Not just is the digital now far from the present , but it &apos;s in direct competition with it , and this is because not just am I absent from it , but so are you .
Not just are we absent from it , but so is everyone else .
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night , shop for Parisian macarons , and leave video messages that get picked up later .
At all times , I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you , while I sustain the illusion that I &apos;m tapped into you in real time .
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
There were those with power and water , and those without .
There are those who went back to their lives , and those who are still displaced after so many months .
For some reason , technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does , and then , like an ironic slap in the face , it makes it true .
For example , it &apos;s said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets .
Now if this rift , which is already so great in many parts of the world , between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology , isn &apos;t somehow bridged , there will be ruptures between the digital and the real .
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
How does one live inside distraction ?
We might think that those younger than us , those who are born into this , will adapt more naturally .
Possibly , but I remember my childhood .
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me .
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube , and Vienna had a Spanish riding school .
If I were a child today , I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks , but it really wouldn &apos;t be the same , because much later , I went to Vienna , and I went to the Spanish riding school , and I could feel my grandfather right beside me .
Night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me .
And even here , when I look at the Great Bear , I get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and I can get back that feeling of being a child again .
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact , but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact .
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core , because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget , even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable .
We want to clutch , and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments .
They &apos;re like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
By archiving everything , we think that we can store it , but time is not data .
It cannot be stored .
You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment .
It might have happened while we were playing an instrument , or looking into the eyes of someone we &apos;ve known for a very long time .
At such moments , our selves are complete .
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one .
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
The present joins a flow of time from before and after .
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother .
I wanted to learn to skip , and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it .
I wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cubing and chopping for a whole month .
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take , that time can &apos;t be fought , and because it will pass and it will move , we owe the present moment our full attention .
Attention is time .
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention , and definitely from my grandmother , love and attention were one and the same thing .
The digital world cannibalizes time , and in doing so , I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves .
It threatens the flow of love .
But we don &apos;t need to let it .
We can choose otherwise .
We &apos;ve seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it .
We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time .
We can choose to take time back .
Thank you .

Michael Porter : Why business can be good at solving social problems
Why do we turn to nonprofits , NGOs and governments to solve society &apos;s biggest problems ? Michael Porter admits he &apos;s biased , as a business school professor , but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water . Why ? Because when business solves a problem , it makes a profit -- which lets that solution grow .
I think we &apos;re all aware that the world today is full of problems .
We &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
Serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
Poor nutrition , access to water , climate change , deforestation , lack of skills , insecurity , not enough food , not enough healthcare , pollution .
There &apos;s problem after problem , and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems .
We &apos;re all very aware .
Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;ve been struggling with , coming from my very different perspective .
I &apos;m not a social problem guy .
I &apos;m a guy that works with business , helps business make money .
God forbid .
So why are we having so many problems with these social problems , and really is there any role for business , and if so , what is that role ?
I think that in order to address that question , we have to step back and think about how we &apos;ve understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face .
Now , I think many have seen business as the problem , or at least one of the problems , in many of the social challenges we face .
You know , think of the fast food industry , the drug industry , the banking industry .
You know , this is a low point in the respect for business .
Business is not seen as the solution .
It &apos;s seen as the problem now , for most people .
And rightly so , in many cases .
There &apos;s a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
So this perspective is perhaps justified .
How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems , these many issues that we face in society ?
Well , we &apos;ve tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs , in terms of government , in terms of philanthropy .
Indeed , the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations .
This is a unique , new organizational form that we &apos;ve seen grown up .
Enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
And many of us here are deeply involved in that .
I &apos;m a business school professor , but I &apos;ve actually founded , I think , now , four nonprofits .
Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem , that was what I did , form a nonprofit .
That was the way we &apos;ve thought about how to deal with these issues .
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way .
But I think at this moment , we &apos;ve been at this for quite a while .
We &apos;ve been aware of these problems for decades .
We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities , and there &apos;s an awkward reality .
The awkward reality is we &apos;re not making fast enough progress .
We &apos;re not winning .
These problems still seem very daunting and very intractable , and any solutions we &apos;re achieving are small solutions .
We &apos;re making incremental progress .
What &apos;s the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems ?
If we cut all the complexity away , we have the problem of scale .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can make progress . We can show benefits .
We can show results . We can make things better .
We &apos;re helping . We &apos;re doing better . We &apos;re doing good .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can &apos;t make a large-scale impact on these problems .
Why is that ?
Because we don &apos;t have the resources .
And that &apos;s really clear now .
And that &apos;s clearer now than it &apos;s been for decades .
There &apos;s simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model .
There &apos;s not enough tax revenue , there &apos;s not enough philanthropic donations , to deal with these problems the way we &apos;re dealing with them now .
We &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
So if it &apos;s fundamentally a resource problem , where are the resources in society ?
How are those resources really created , the resources we &apos;re going to need to deal with all these societal challenges ?
Well there , I think the answer is very clear : They &apos;re in business .
All wealth is actually created by business .
Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit .
That &apos;s how all wealth is created .
It &apos;s meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations .
That &apos;s where all the resources come from .
Only business can actually create resources .
Other institutions can utilize them to do important work , but only business can create them .
And business creates them when it &apos;s able to meet a need at a profit .
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
The question then is , how do we tap into this ?
How do we tap into this ?
Business generates those resources when it makes a profit .
That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they &apos;re trying to solve .
But that profit is the magic .
Why ? Because that profit allows whatever solution we &apos;ve created to be infinitely scalable .
Because if we can make a profit , we can do it for 10 , 100 , a million , 100 million , a billion .
The solution becomes self-sustaining .
That &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
Now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
Well , one line of thinking is , let &apos;s take this profit and redeploy it into social problems .
Business should give more .
Business should be more responsible .
And that &apos;s been the path that we &apos;ve been on in business .
But again , this path that we &apos;ve been on is not getting us where we need to go .
Now , I started out as a strategy professor , and I &apos;m still a strategy professor .
I &apos;m proud of that .
But I &apos;ve also , over the years , worked more and more on social issues .
I &apos;ve worked on healthcare , the environment , economic development , reducing poverty , and as I worked more and more in the social field , I started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life , in a way .
The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually , there &apos;s a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance .
The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem .
The classic example is pollution .
If business pollutes , it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution .
Reducing pollution is expensive , therefore businesses don &apos;t want to do it .
It &apos;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
It &apos;s too expensive to have a safe working environment , therefore business makes more money if they don &apos;t have a safe working environment .
That &apos;s been the conventional wisdom .
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom .
They resisted environmental improvement .
They resisted workplace improvement .
That thinking has led to , I think , much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business , that I come to criticize in business .
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues , one after another , and actually , the more I tried to address them myself , personally , in a few cases , through nonprofits that I was involved with , the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite .
Business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
That &apos;s a very simplistic view .
The deeper we get into these issues , the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems .
That &apos;s where the real profit comes .
Let &apos;s take pollution .
We &apos;ve learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit .
It saves money .
It makes the business more productive and efficient .
It doesn &apos;t waste resources .
Having a safer working environment actually , and avoiding accidents , it makes the business more profitable , because it &apos;s a sign of good processes .
Accidents are expensive and costly .
Issue by issue by issue , we start to learn that actually there &apos;s no trade-off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense .
Another issue is health .
I mean , what we &apos;ve found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure , because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent .
The deeper work , the new work , the new thinking on the interface between business and social problems is actually showing that there &apos;s a fundamental , deep synergy , particularly if you &apos;re not thinking in the very short run .
In the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there &apos;s fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we &apos;re learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face ?
Imagine if we could do that , because if we could do it , we could scale .
We could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity .
And guess what ? That &apos;s happening now , finally , partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade .
We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products .
This is an example of Jain Irrigation .
This is a company that &apos;s brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers , reducing substantially the use of water .
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that &apos;s figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually , yes , be responsible , but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business .
There &apos;s a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .
And the question is , how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value ?
This is what I call shared value : addressing a social issue with a business model .
That &apos;s shared value .
Shared value is capitalism , but it &apos;s a higher kind of capitalism .
It &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously .
It &apos;s finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale .
We can address shared value at multiple levels .
It &apos;s real . It &apos;s happening .
But in order to get this solution working , we have to now change how business sees itself , and this is thankfully underway .
Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn &apos;t worry about social problems , that this was sort of something on the side , that somebody else was doing it .
We &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
But we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have NGOs and government working in partnership with business .
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships , that have found these ways to collaborate .
The governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way .
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently , and if we can get others seeing business differently , we can change the world .
I know it . I &apos;m seeing it .
I &apos;m feeling it .
Young people , I think , my Harvard Business School students , are getting it .
If we can break down this sort of divide , this unease , this tension , this sense that we &apos;re not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , I think , can have solutions .
Thank you .

Stuart Firestein : The pursuit of ignorance
What does real scientific work look like ? As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes : It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like &quot; farting around … in the dark . &quot; In this witty talk , Firestein gets to the heart of science as it is really practiced and suggests that we should value what we don &apos;t know -- or &quot; high-quality ignorance &quot; -- just as much as what we know .
There is an ancient proverb that says it &apos;s very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room , especially when there is no cat .
I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works -- bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science .
Science , we generally are told , is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world , for gaining facts , for gaining data , that it &apos;s rule-based , that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we &apos;ve been doing this for 14 generations or so now , and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard , cold facts out of the data .
I &apos;d like to tell you that &apos;s not the case .
So there &apos;s the scientific method , but what &apos;s really going on is this . &#91; The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around &#93; And it &apos;s going on kind of like that .
&#91; ... in the dark &#93; So what is the difference , then , between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived ?
So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University , where I &apos;m both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works .
We do this by studying the sense of smell , the sense of olfaction , and in the laboratory , it &apos;s a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working , and , well , frankly , it &apos;s kind of exhilarating .
But at the same time , it &apos;s my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that &apos;s a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it &apos;s quite challenging and it &apos;s quite interesting , but I have to say , it &apos;s not so exhilarating .
So what was the difference ?
Well , the course I was and am teaching is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. It &apos;s 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called &quot; Principles of Neural Science &quot; by three famous neuroscientists .
This book comes in at 1,414 pages , it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds .
Just to put that in some perspective , that &apos;s the weight of two normal human brains .
So I began to realize , by the end of this course , that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain .
That &apos;s clearly not true .
And they must also have this idea , I suppose , that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books .
And that &apos;s not really the case either .
When I go to a meeting , after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues , we never talk about what we know .
We talk about what we don &apos;t know .
We talk about what still has to get done , what &apos;s so critical to get done in the lab .
Indeed , this was , I think , best said by Marie Curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done .
This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree , I should say .
I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie , because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect . That &apos;s the real thing .
It is true that her papers are , to this day , stored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française in a concrete room that &apos;s lead-lined , and if you &apos;re a scholar and you want access to these notebooks , you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit , so it &apos;s pretty scary business .
Nonetheless , this is what I think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists , the what-remains-to-be-done .
This is the stuff that &apos;s exhilarating and interesting .
It is , if you will , the ignorance .
That &apos;s what was missing .
So I thought , well , maybe I should teach a course on ignorance , something I can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
So I did start teaching this course on ignorance , and it &apos;s been quite interesting and I &apos;d like to tell you to go to the website .
You can find all sorts of information there . It &apos;s wide open .
And it &apos;s been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don &apos;t know .
Now I use this word &quot; ignorance , &quot; of course , to be at least in part intentionally provocative , because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don &apos;t mean any of those .
So I don &apos;t mean stupidity , I don &apos;t mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data .
The ignorant are clearly unenlightened , unaware , uninformed , and present company today excepted , often occupy elected offices , it seems to me .
That &apos;s another story , perhaps .
I mean a different kind of ignorance .
I mean a kind of ignorance that &apos;s less pejorative , a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge , something that &apos;s just not there to be known or isn &apos;t known well enough yet or we can &apos;t make predictions from , the kind of ignorance that &apos;s maybe best summed up in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell , perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein , who said , &quot; Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science . &quot;
I think it &apos;s a wonderful idea : thoroughly conscious ignorance .
So that &apos;s the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today , but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts ?
So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate .
We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts , and it seems impregnable , it seems impossible .
How can you ever know all of this ?
And indeed , the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate .
In 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
There &apos;s about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate , and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published .
Divide that by the number of minutes in a year , and you wind up with three new papers per minute .
So I &apos;ve been up here a little over 10 minutes , I &apos;ve already lost three papers .
I have to get out of here actually . I have to go read .
So what do we do about this ? Well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
We just don &apos;t worry about it , in a way .
The facts are important . You have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist . That &apos;s true .
But knowing a lot of stuff doesn &apos;t make you a scientist .
You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter .
But in science , knowing a lot of stuff is not the point .
Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance .
So knowledge is a big subject , but I would say ignorance is a bigger one .
So this leads us to maybe think about , a little bit about , some of the models of science that we tend to use , and I &apos;d like to disabuse you of some of them .
So one of them , a popular one , is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another .
This is clearly not true . For one , with puzzles , the manufacturer has guaranteed that there &apos;s a solution .
We don &apos;t have any such guarantee .
Indeed , there are many of us who aren &apos;t so sure about the manufacturer .
So I think the puzzle model doesn &apos;t work .
Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion .
So peel by peel , you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the way it works either .
Another one , a kind of popular one , is the iceberg idea , that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden .
But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed .
We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is , or we could just wait for it to melt , I suppose , these days , but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg . Right ?
Or make it manageable . But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case .
I think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well , where no matter how many buckets you take out , there &apos;s always another bucket of water to be had , or my particularly favorite one , with the effect and everything , the ripples on a pond .
the important thing to realize is that our ignorance , the circumference of this knowledge , also grows with knowledge .
So the knowledge generates ignorance .
This is really well said , I thought , by George Bernard Shaw .
This is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein &apos;s work , in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers . &#91; &quot; Science is always wrong . It never solves a problem without creating 10 more . &quot; &#93; I find that kind of glorious , and I think he &apos;s precisely right , plus it &apos;s a kind of job security .
As it turns out , he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation , that every answer begets more questions .
I love that term , &quot; question propagation , &quot; this idea of questions propagating out there .
So I &apos;d say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge .
It &apos;s rather kind of the other way around , really .
What do we use this knowledge for ?
What are we using this collection of facts for ?
We &apos;re using it to make better ignorance , to come up with , if you will , higher-quality ignorance .
Because , you know , there &apos;s low-quality ignorance and there &apos;s high-quality ignorance . It &apos;s not all the same .
Scientists argue about this all the time .
Sometimes we call them bull sessions .
Sometimes we call them grant proposals .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s what the argument is about .
It &apos;s the ignorance . It &apos;s the what we don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s what makes a good question .
So how do we think about these questions ?
I &apos;m going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments .
This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it .
So what you know , you can know anywhere from nothing to everything , of course , and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot .
So let &apos;s put a point on the graph . There &apos;s an undergraduate .
Doesn &apos;t know much but they have a lot of interest .
They &apos;re interested in almost everything .
Now you look at a master &apos;s student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it &apos;s been narrowed somewhat .
And finally you get your Ph.D. , where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing . What &apos;s really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because , of course , when it dips below the zero axis , there , it gets into a negative area .
That &apos;s where you find people like me , I &apos;m afraid .
So the important thing here is that this can all be changed .
This whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x-axis .
So instead of how much you know about it , we could say , &quot; What can you ask about it ? &quot;
So yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist , but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff . That just makes you a geek , right ?
Knowing a lot of stuff , the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions , to be able to frame thoughtful , interesting questions , because that &apos;s where the real work is .
Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions .
I &apos;m a neuroscientist , so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience ?
Because it &apos;s not always quite so straightforward .
So , for example , we could say , well what is it that the brain does ?
Well , one thing the brain does , it moves us around .
We walk around on two legs .
That seems kind of simple , somehow or another .
I mean , virtually everybody over 10 months of age walks around on two legs , right ?
So that maybe is not that interesting .
So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at .
How about the visual system ?
There it is , the visual system .
I mean , we love our visual systems . We do all kinds of cool stuff .
Indeed , there are over 12,000 neuroscientists who work on the visual system , from the retina to the visual cortex , in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work .
But now here &apos;s the thing : Our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does .
We have TV , we have movies , we have animation , we have photography , we have pattern recognition , all of these sorts of things .
They work differently than our visual systems in some cases , but nonetheless we &apos;ve been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system .
Somehow or another , a hundred years of robotics , you never saw a robot walk on two legs , because robots don &apos;t walk on two legs because it &apos;s not such an easy thing to do .
A hundred years of robotics , and we can &apos;t get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other .
You ask them to go up an inclined plane , and they fall over .
Turn around , and they fall over . It &apos;s a serious problem .
So what is it that &apos;s the most difficult thing for a brain to do ?
What ought we to be studying ?
Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs , or the motor system .
I &apos;ll give you an example from my own lab , my own particularly smelly question , since we work on the sense of smell .
But here &apos;s a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation .
These are just plain old molecules , but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face , you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose .
If there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
How do we turn molecules into perceptions ?
What &apos;s the process by which that could happen ?
Here &apos;s another example : two very simple molecules , again in this kind of chemical notation .
It might be easier to visualize them this way , so the gray circles are carbon atoms , the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms .
Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it , and yet one of them , heptyl acetate , has the distinct odor of a pear , and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana .
So there are two really interesting questions here , it seems to me .
One is , how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that &apos;s so clear as a pear or a banana ?
And secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
I mean , that &apos;s remarkable to me , clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet .
And you don &apos;t even think about it , do you ?
So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions .
I like to quote because I think dead people shouldn &apos;t be excluded from the conversation .
And I also think it &apos;s important to realize that the conversation &apos;s been going on for a while , by the way .
So Erwin Schrodinger , a great quantum physicist and , I think , philosopher , points out how you have to &quot; abide by ignorance for an indefinite period &quot; of time .
And it &apos;s this abiding by ignorance that I think we have to learn how to do .
This is a tricky thing . This is not such an easy business .
I guess it comes down to our education system , so I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because I think that &apos;s where it really has to play out .
So for one , let &apos;s face it , in the age of Google and Wikipedia , the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change .
We just can &apos;t sell facts for a living anymore .
They &apos;re available with a click of the mouse , or if you want to , you could probably just ask the wall one of these days , wherever they &apos;re going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff .
So what do we have to do ? We have to give our students a taste for the boundaries , for what &apos;s outside that circumference , for what &apos;s outside the facts , what &apos;s just beyond the facts .
How do we do that ?
Well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
We currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing .
So in second grade , all the kids are interested in science , They like to take stuff apart . They have great curiosity .
They like to investigate things . They go to science museums .
They like to play around . They &apos;re in second grade .
They &apos;re interested .
But by 11th or 12th grade , fewer than 10 percent of them have any interest in science whatsoever , let alone a desire to go into science as a career .
So we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody &apos;s head .
Is this what we want ?
I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls &quot; the bulimic method of education . &quot;
You know . You can imagine what it is .
We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever .
This can &apos;t possibly continue to go on .
So what do we do ? Well the geneticists , I have to say , have an interesting maxim they live by .
Geneticists always say , you always get what you screen for .
And that &apos;s meant as a warning .
So we always will get what we screen for , and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods .
Well , we hear a lot about testing and evaluation , and we have to think carefully when we &apos;re testing whether we &apos;re evaluating or whether we &apos;re weeding , whether we &apos;re weeding people out , whether we &apos;re making some cut .
Evaluation is one thing . You hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days , in the educational literature , but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error .
It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback .
That &apos;s different than weeding , and usually , I have to tell you , when people talk about evaluation , evaluating students , evaluating teachers , evaluating schools , evaluating programs , that they &apos;re really talking about weeding .
And that &apos;s a bad thing , because then you will get what you select for , which is what we &apos;ve gotten so far .
So I &apos;d say what we need is a test that says , &quot; What is x ? &quot;
and the answers are &quot; I don &apos;t know , because no one does , &quot; or &quot; What &apos;s the question ? &quot; Even better .
Or , &quot; You know what , I &apos;ll look it up , I &apos;ll ask someone , I &apos;ll phone someone . I &apos;ll find out . &quot;
Because that &apos;s what we want people to do , and that &apos;s how you evaluate them .
And maybe for the advanced placement classes , it could be , &quot; Here &apos;s the answer . What &apos;s the next question ? &quot;
That &apos;s the one I like in particular .
So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats , who said &quot; Education is not about filling buckets ; So I &apos;d say , let &apos;s get out the matches .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu : A mouse . A laser beam . A manipulated memory .
Can we edit the content of our memories ? It &apos;s a sci-fi-tinged question that Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu are asking in their lab at MIT . Essentially , the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory . In this unexpectedly amusing talk they share not only how , but -- more importantly -- why they do this .
Steve Ramirez : My first year of grad school , I found myself in my bedroom eating lots of Ben &amp; amp ; Jerry &apos;s watching some trashy TV and maybe , maybe listening to Taylor Swift .
I had just gone through a breakup .
So for the longest time , all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again , wishing that I could get rid of that gut-wrenching , visceral &quot; blah &quot; feeling .
Now , as it turns out , I &apos;m a neuroscientist , so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful , emotional undertones that color in that memory , are largely mediated by separate brain systems .
And so I thought , what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact ?
Then I realized , maybe that &apos;s a little bit lofty for now .
So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with ?
Could we jump-start that memory back to life , maybe even play with the contents of that memory ?
All that said , there is one person in the entire world right now that I really hope is not watching this talk .
So there is a catch . There is a catch .
These ideas probably remind you of &quot; Total Recall , &quot; &quot; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , &quot; or of &quot; Inception . &quot;
But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
Xu Liu : Test mice .
As neuroscientists , we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works .
And today , we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light .
To do this , there &apos;s only two simple steps to follow .
First , you find and label a memory in the brain , and then you activate it with a switch .
As simple as that .
SR : Are you convinced ?
So , turns out finding a memory in the brain isn &apos;t all that easy .
XL : Indeed . This is way more difficult than , let &apos;s say , finding a needle in a haystack , because at least , you know , the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on .
But memory is not .
And also , there &apos;s way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack .
So yeah , this task does seem to be daunting .
But luckily , we got help from the brain itself .
It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory , and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory .
SR : So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex ?
If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now , you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory .
Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus , which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear , which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory .
XL : When you zoom in into the hippocampus , of course you will see lots of cells , but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory , because whenever a cell is active , like when it &apos;s forming a memory , it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active .
SR : So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody &apos;s probably working there at any given moment , in a very real sense , there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working .
They &apos;re sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active .
XL : So we clipped part of this sensor , and attached that to a switch to control the cells , and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice .
So whenever a memory is being formed , any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed .
SR : So here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory , for example .
The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells , but the green brain cells , the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory .
So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear .
You &apos;re actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now .
XL : Now , for the switch we have been talking about , ideally , the switch has to act really fast .
It shouldn &apos;t take minutes or hours to work .
It should act at the speed of the brain , in milliseconds .
SR : So what do you think , Xu ?
Could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
XL : Nah . Drugs are pretty messy . They spread everywhere .
And also it takes them forever to act on cells .
So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time .
So Steve , how about let &apos;s zap the brain with electricity ?
SR : So electricity is pretty fast , but we probably wouldn &apos;t be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory , and we &apos;d probably fry the brain .
XL : Oh . That &apos;s true . So it looks like , hmm , indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light .
SR : So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light .
So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light -- XL : That &apos;s pretty fast .
SR : -- and because normally brain cells don &apos;t respond to pulses of light , so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light-sensitive switch .
Now to do that , first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams .
XL : Yep . You heard it right .
We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain .
SR : And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics .
Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off , and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin , seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell .
You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it , and in this case we click it on with pulses of light .
XL : So we attach this light-sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we &apos;ve been talking about and inject this into the brain .
So whenever a memory is being formed , any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see .
SR : So let &apos;s put all of this to the test now .
What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here , and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box .
They learn that something bad happened here .
Now with our system , the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory , only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin .
XL : When you are as small as a mouse , it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you .
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected .
Whenever a mouse is in fear , it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box , trying to not move any part of its body , and this posture is called freezing .
So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box , and when we put them back into the same box , it will basically show freezing because it doesn &apos;t want to be detected by any potential threats in this box .
SR : So you can think of freezing as , you &apos;re walking down the street minding your own business , and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend , and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking , &quot; What do I do ? Do I say hi ?
Do I shake their hand ? Do I turn around and run away ?
Do I sit here and pretend like I don &apos;t exist ? &quot;
Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you , that temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look .
XL : However , if you put the mouse in a completely different new box , like the next one , it will not be afraid of this box because there &apos;s no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment .
But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time , we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before ?
Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment ?
SR : All right , and here &apos;s the million-dollar experiment .
Now to bring back to life the memory of that day , I remember that the Red Sox had just won , it was a green spring day , perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis , # justsaying .
Now Xu and I , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique .
XL : And this is what we saw .
When we first put the mouse into this box , it &apos;s exploring , sniffing around , walking around , minding its own business , because actually by nature , mice are pretty curious animals .
They want to know , what &apos;s going on in this new box ?
It &apos;s interesting .
But the moment we turned on the laser , like you see now , all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode .
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
So indeed , it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment .
While watching this , Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself .
So after the experiment , the two of us just left the room without saying anything .
After a kind of long , awkward period of time , Steve broke the silence .
SR : &quot; Did that just work ? &quot;
XL : &quot; Yes , &quot; I said . &quot; Indeed it worked ! &quot;
We &apos;re really excited about this .
And then we published our findings in the journal Nature .
Ever since the publication of our work , we &apos;ve been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet .
Maybe we can take a look at some of those .
&#91; &quot; OMGGGGG FINALLY ... so much more to come , virtual reality , neural manipulation , visual dream emulation ... neural coding , &apos; writing and re-writing of memories &apos; , mental illnesses . Ahhh the future is awesome &quot; &#93; SR : So the first thing that you &apos;ll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work .
Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote , because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman &apos;s voice , it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I &apos;ve heard come our way .
But as you &apos;ll see , it &apos;s not the only opinion that &apos;s out there .
&#91; &quot; This scares the hell out of me ... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years ? ! OH MY GOD WE &apos;RE DOOMED &quot; &#93; XL : Indeed , if we take a look at the second one , I think we can all agree that it &apos;s , meh , probably not as positive .
But this also reminds us that , although we are still working with mice , it &apos;s probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control .
SR : Now , in the spirit of the third quote , we want to tell you about a recent project that we &apos;ve been working on in lab that we &apos;ve called Project Inception .
&#91; &quot; They should make a movie about this . Where they plant ideas into peoples minds , so they can control them for their own personal gain . We &apos;ll call it : Inception . &quot; &#93; So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory , what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory ?
Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory ?
XL : So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic , but if just for simplicity , let &apos;s imagine memory as a movie clip .
So far what we &apos;ve told you is basically we can control this &quot; play &quot; button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time , anywhere .
But is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different from the original ?
Yes we can .
Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before , but at the same time , if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory , this will change the memory .
It &apos;s sort of like making a remix tape .
SR : So how do we do this ?
Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain , we can start by taking our animals , and let &apos;s say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before .
Now the next day , we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they &apos;ve never experienced before .
We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box .
So what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
So here we &apos;re trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves .
We &apos;re just trying to connect the two .
So to test if we had done so , we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box .
Again , we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks , and now the animal suddenly freezes .
It &apos;s as though it &apos;s recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened .
So it formed a false memory , because it &apos;s falsely fearing an environment where , technically speaking , nothing bad actually happened to it .
XL : So , so far we are only talking about this light-controlled &quot; on &quot; switch .
In fact , we also have a light-controlled &quot; off &quot; switch , and it &apos;s very easy to imagine that by installing this light-controlled &quot; off &quot; switch , we can also turn off a memory , any time , anywhere .
So everything we &apos;ve been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind , with its seemingly mysterious properties , is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with .
SR : And for me personally , I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we &apos;d like .
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
Now , I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality , because we &apos;re living in a time where it &apos;s possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality .
XL : Nowadays , people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories , whether that &apos;s old or new , positive or negative , all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works .
SR : For example , one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory , just like that .
That &apos;s exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes .
Now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice , which rumor has it is a pleasurable experience .
XL : Indeed , we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn &apos;t have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination .
SR : And finally , what do we make of all this ?
How do we push this technology forward ?
These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab , and so one goal of today &apos;s talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that &apos;s possible in modern neuroscience , but now , just as importantly , to actively engage everybody in this conversation .
So let &apos;s think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here , because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us .
Thank you . XL : Thank you .

Peter Attia : Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
As a young surgeon , Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes . She was overweight , he thought , and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation . But years later , Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder : is our understanding of diabetes right ? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity , and not the other way around ? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war .
I &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital , taking emergency call .
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot .
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her .
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
That wasn &apos;t being asked .
The question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an amputation ?
Now , looking back on that night , I &apos;d love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I &apos;d shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer .
In her case , I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life .
The cancer was too advanced .
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
I brought some for her parents .
But more importantly , see , I passed no judgment on her , because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself .
So why was it that , just a few nights later , as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation , why did I hold her in such bitter contempt ?
You see , unlike the woman the night before , this woman had type 2 diabetes .
She was fat .
And we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
I mean , how hard can it be ?
As I looked down at her in the bed , I thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
Why did I feel justified in judging her ?
I &apos;d like to say I don &apos;t know .
But I actually do .
You see , in the hubris of my youth , I thought I had her all figured out .
She ate too much . She got unlucky .
She got diabetes . Case closed .
Ironically , at that time in my life , I was also doing cancer research , immune-based therapies for melanoma , to be specific , and in that world I was actually taught to question everything , to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards .
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma , I never once questioned the conventional wisdom .
I actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science .
Three years later , I found out how wrong I was .
But this time , I was the patient .
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I &apos;d gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
Some of you may have heard of this .
I had become insulin-resistant .
You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
And insulin resistance , as its name suggests , is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job .
Once you &apos;re insulin-resistant , you &apos;re on your way to getting diabetes , which is what happens when your pancreas can &apos;t keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin .
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise , and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease , cancer , even Alzheimer &apos;s disease , and amputations , just like that woman a few years earlier .
With that scare , I got busy changing my diet radically , adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking .
I did this and lost 40 pounds , weirdly while exercising less .
I , as you can see , I guess I &apos;m not overweight anymore .
More importantly , I don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
But most important , I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn &apos;t go away : How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right ?
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me , was it possible it was failing someone else ?
And underlying these questions , I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance .
Now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
Logically , then , if you want to treat insulin resistance , you get people to lose weight , right ?
You treat the obesity .
But what if we have it backwards ?
What if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
In fact , what if it &apos;s a symptom of a much deeper problem , the tip of a proverbial iceberg ?
I know it sounds crazy because we &apos;re obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic , but hear me out .
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell ?
I &apos;m not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of ourselves to partition fuel , as I alluded to a moment ago , taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately .
When we become insulin-resistant , the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state .
So now , when insulin says to a cell , I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe , the cell , in effect , says , &quot; No thanks , I &apos;d actually rather store this energy . &quot;
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells , it &apos;s probably the safest place to store it .
So for many of us , about 75 million Americans , the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat , not the reverse , getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat .
This is a really subtle distinction , but the implication could be profound .
Consider the following analogy : Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table .
Sure , the bruise hurts like hell , and you almost certainly don &apos;t like the discolored look , but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem .
In fact , it &apos;s the opposite . It &apos;s a healthy response to the trauma , all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body .
Now , imagine we thought bruises were the problem , and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises : masking creams , painkillers , you name it , all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables .
How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect ?
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
Getting it wrong , and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins .
Cause and effect .
So what I &apos;m suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance .
Maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening , an underlying epidemic , the one we ought to be worried about ?
Let &apos;s look at some suggestive facts .
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
And by the way , they don &apos;t appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people .
Conversely , we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant , and by the way , they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic disease I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts .
Now I don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy .
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance , and you can be lean and have it , this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what &apos;s going on .
So what if we &apos;re fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
Even worse , what if blaming the obese means we &apos;re blaming the victims ?
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong ?
Personally , I can &apos;t afford the luxury of arrogance anymore , let alone the luxury of certainty .
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but I &apos;m wide open to others .
Now , my hypothesis , because everybody always asks me , is this .
If you ask yourself , what &apos;s a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant , the answer probably isn &apos;t too much food .
It &apos;s more likely too much glucose : blood sugar .
Now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there &apos;s even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
So if you put these physiological processes to work , I &apos;d hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains , sugars and starches that &apos;s driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes , but through insulin resistance , you see , and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising .
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago , I did it simply by restricting those things , which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience .
But that doesn &apos;t mean my bias is wrong , and most important , all of this can be tested scientifically .
But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity , diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested .
I &apos;m betting my career on this .
Today , I devote all of my time to working on this problem , and I &apos;ll go wherever the science takes me .
I &apos;ve decided that what I can &apos;t and won &apos;t do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don &apos;t .
I &apos;ve been humbled enough by all I don &apos;t know .
For the past year , I &apos;ve been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country , and the best part is , just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals , we &apos;ve done the same thing .
We &apos;ve recruited a team of scientific rivals , the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what &apos;s at the heart of this epidemic .
Some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
Others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
Others think it &apos;s too many refined grains and starches .
But this team of multi-disciplinary , highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things .
First , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer .
And two , if we &apos;re willing to be wrong , if we &apos;re willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer , we can solve this problem .
I know it &apos;s tempting to want an answer right now , some form of action or policy , some dietary prescription -- eat this , not that — but if we want to get it right , we &apos;re going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription .
Briefly , to address this , our research program is focused around three meta-themes , or questions .
First , how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism , hormones and enzymes , and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms ?
Second , based on these insights , can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that &apos;s safe and practical to implement ?
And finally , once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet , how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception ?
Just because you know what to do doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re always going to do it .
Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier , and believe it or not , that can be studied scientifically .
I don &apos;t know how this journey is going to end , but this much seems clear to me , at least : We can &apos;t keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did .
Most of them actually want to do the right thing , but they have to know what that is , and it &apos;s got to work .
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance , because as medical professionals , we &apos;ve shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals : open minds , the courage to throw out yesterday &apos;s ideas when they don &apos;t appear to be working , and the understanding that scientific truth isn &apos;t final , but constantly evolving .
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science .
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
seven years ago .
I wish I could speak with that woman again .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sorry I am .
I &apos;d say , as a doctor , I delivered the best clinical care I could , but as a human being , I let you down .
You didn &apos;t need my judgment and my contempt .
You needed my empathy and compassion , and above all else , you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn &apos;t let the system down .
Maybe the system , of which I was a part , was letting you down .
If you &apos;re watching this now , I hope you can forgive me .

Paul Pholeros : How to reduce poverty ? Fix homes
In 1985 , architect Paul Pholeros was challenged by the director of an Aboriginal-controlled health service to &quot; stop people getting sick &quot; in a small indigenous community in south Australia . The key insights : think beyond medicine and fix the local environment . In this sparky , interactive talk , Pholeros describes projects undertaken by Healthabitat , the organization he now runs to help reduce poverty--through practical design fixes--in Australia and beyond .
The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal .
I don &apos;t think anyone in this room would disagree .
What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars use the words , it all just sounds so , so simple .
Now , I &apos;ve got no bucket of money today and I &apos;ve got no policy to release , and I certainly haven &apos;t got a guitar .
I &apos;ll leave that to others .
But I do have an idea , and that idea is called Housing for Health .
Housing For Health works with poor people .
It works in the places where they live , and the work is done to improve their health .
Over the last 28 years , this tough , grinding , dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia , and more recently overseas , and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments .
It can improve health , and it can play a part in reducing , if not eliminating , poverty .
I &apos;m going to start where the story began , 1985 , in central Australia .
A man called Yami Lester , an Aboriginal man , was running a health service .
Eighty percent of what walked in the door , in terms of illness , was infectious disease -- third world , developing world infectious disease , caused by a poor living environment .
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs .
He got a medical doctor .
He got an environmental health guy .
And he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project .
Yami told us at that first meeting , there &apos;s no money .
Always a good start , no money .
You have six months .
And I want you to start on a project which in his language he called &quot; uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku , &quot; which , translated , is &quot; a plan to stop people getting sick , &quot; a profound brief .
That was our task .
First step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aiming at .
After six months of work , he came to my office and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper .
&#91; Washing , clothes , wastewater , nutrition ... &#93; Now , I was very , very unimpressed .
Come on .
Big ideas need big words and preferably a lot of them .
This didn &apos;t fit the bill .
What I didn &apos;t see and what you can &apos;t see is that he &apos;d assembled thousands of pages of local , national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets .
The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate , so the story had to be told in pictures of what were these goals .
We work with the community , not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn &apos;t understand .
So we had the goals , and each one of these goals -- and I won &apos;t go through them all — puts at the center the person and their health issue , and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good .
And the highest priority , you see on the screen , is washing people once a day , particularly children .
Now I hope most of you are thinking , &quot; What ? That sounds simple . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m going to ask you all a very personal question .
This morning before you came , who could have had a wash using a shower ?
I &apos;m not going to ask if you had a shower , because I &apos;m too polite . That &apos;s it . Okay . All right .
I think it &apos;s fair to say , most people here could have had a shower this morning .
I &apos;m going to ask you to do some more work .
I want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen .
I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head .
Have you all got a house ? I &apos;m going to ask you to live there for a few months , so make sure you &apos;ve got it right .
It &apos;s in the northwest of Western Australia , very pleasant place .
Okay . Let &apos;s see if your shower in that house is working .
I hear some &quot; aw &quot; s and I hear some &quot; aah . &quot;
If you get a green tick , your shower &apos;s working .
You and your kids are fine .
If you get a red cross , well , I &apos;ve looked carefully around the room and it &apos;s not going to make much difference to this crew .
Why ? Because you &apos;re all too old .
And I know that &apos;s going to come as a shock to some of you , but you are .
Now before you get offended and leave , I &apos;ve got to say that being too old in this case means that pretty much everyone in the room , I think , is over five years of age .
We &apos;re really concerned with kids naught to five .
And why ? Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs , the common infectious diseases of the eyes , the ears , the chest and the skin that , if they occur in the first five years of life , permanently damage those organs .
They leave a lifelong remnant .
That means that , by the age of five , you can &apos;t see as well for the rest of your life .
You can &apos;t hear as well for the rest of your life .
You can &apos;t breath as well . You &apos;ve lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five .
And even skin infection , which we originally thought wasn &apos;t that big a problem , mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure , needing dialysis at age 40 .
This is a big deal , so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
Those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we &apos;ve looked at nationally around Australia , the same proportion .
What you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not-so-famous houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people , 35 percent had a working shower .
Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems , and 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet .
These are by a simple , standard test : In the case of the shower , does it have hot and cold water , two taps that work , a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body , and a drain that takes the water away ?
Not well designed , not beautiful , not elegant -- just that they function .
And the same test for the electrical system and the toilets .
Housing for Health projects aren &apos;t about measuring failure .
They &apos;re actually about improving houses .
We start on day one of every project -- we &apos;ve learned , we don &apos;t make promises , we don &apos;t do reports .
We arrive in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , trades , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
By the evening of the first day , a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning .
That work continues for six to 12 months until all the houses are improved and we &apos;ve spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house .
That &apos;s our average budget .
At the end of six months to a year , we test every house again .
It &apos;s very easy to spend money .
It &apos;s very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house , and for a whole house , the nine healthy living practices , we test , check and fix 250 items in every house .
And these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars .
We can get showers up to 86 percent working , we can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working , and we can get 90 percent of toilets working in those 7,500 houses .
Thank you . The teams do a great job , and that &apos;s their work .
I think there &apos;s an obvious question Why do we have to do this work ?
Why are the houses in such poor condition ?
Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance , the sort of things that happen in all our houses .
Things wear out .
Should have been done by state government or local government .
Simply not done , the house doesn &apos;t work .
Twenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction , literally things that are built upside down and back-to-front .
They don &apos;t work . We have to fix them .
And if you &apos;ve lived in Australia in the last 30 years , the final cause -- You will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses .
It &apos;s one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence , which I &apos;ve never seen evidence for , that &apos;s always ruled out as that &apos;s the problem with indigenous housing .
Well , nine percent of what we spend is damage , misuse or abuse of any sort .
We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem .
And we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
The people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution .
Seventy-five percent of our national team in Australia , over 75 at the minute , are actually local , indigenous people from the communities we work in .
They do all aspects of the work .
In 2010 , for example , there were 831 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that &apos;s an important thing .
Our work &apos;s always had a focus on health . That &apos;s the key .
The developing world bug trachoma , it causes blindness .
It &apos;s a developing world illness , and yet , the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage .
Okay , what do we do ?
Well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
Why ? Because that flushes the bug out .
We put washing facilities in the school as well , so kids can wash their faces many times during the day .
We wash the bug out .
Second , the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick . So what do we do ?
We call up the doctor of dust , and there is such a person .
He was loaned to us by a mining company .
He controls dust on mining company sites , and he came out , and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground , the wind-driven dust , so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids .
So we used dirt to stop dust .
We did it . He provided us dust monitors .
We tested and we reduced the dust .
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally .
So how do we do that ?
Well , we call up the doctor of flies , and yes there is a doctor of flies .
As our Aboriginal mate said , &quot; You white fellows ought to get out more . &quot;
And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug .
He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide .
They could trap the flies , send them to him in Perth .
When the bug was in the gut , he &apos;d send back by return post some dung beetles .
The dung beetles ate the camel dung , the flies died through lack of food , and trachoma dropped .
And over the year , trachoma dropped radically in this place , and stayed low .
We changed the environment , not just treated the eyes .
And finally , you get a good eye .
All these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference .
The New South Wales Department of Health , that radical organization , did an independent trial over three years to look at 10 years of the work we &apos;ve been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales , and they found a 40-percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment .
A 40-percent reduction .
Just to show that the principles we &apos;ve used in Australia can be used in other places , I &apos;m just going to go to one other place , and that &apos;s Nepal , and what a beautiful place to go .
We were asked by a small village of 600 people to go in and make toilets where none existed .
Health was poor .
We went in with no grand plan , no grand promises of a great program , just the offer to build two toilets for two families .
It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch , invited by the family into their main room of the house .
It was choking with smoke .
People were cooking on their only fuel source , green timber .
The smoke coming off that timber is choking , and in an enclosed house , you simply can &apos;t breathe .
Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure .
So all of a sudden we had two problems .
We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground . That &apos;s fine .
But all of a sudden now there was a second problem .
How do we actually get the smoke down ? So two problems , and design should be about more than one thing .
Solution : Take human waste , take animal waste , put it into a chamber , out of that extract biogas , methane gas .
The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean , smokeless and free for the family .
I put it to you , is this eliminating poverty ?
And the answer from the Nepali team who is working at the minute would say , don &apos;t be ridiculous , we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim .
And I don &apos;t pretend anything else .
But as we all sit here today , there are now over 100 toilets built in this village and a couple nearby .
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets .
Yami Lama , he &apos;s a young boy .
He &apos;s got significantly less gut infection because he &apos;s now got toilets , and there isn &apos;t human waste on the ground .
Kanji Maya , she &apos;s a mother and a proud one .
She &apos;s probably right now cooking lunch for her family on biogas , smokeless fuel .
Her lungs have got better , and they &apos;ll get better as time increases , because she &apos;s not cooking in the same smoke .
Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it &apos;s shed the gas , he puts it on his crops .
He &apos;s trebled his crop income , more food for the family and more money for the family .
And finally Bishnu , the leader of the team , has now understood that not only have we built toilets , we &apos;ve also built a team , and that team is now working in two villages where they &apos;re training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding .
And that , to me , is the key .
People are not the problem .
We &apos;ve never found that .
The problem : poor living environment , poor housing , and the bugs that do people harm .
None of those are limited by geography , by skin color or by religion . None of them .
The common link between all the work we &apos;ve had to do is one thing , and that &apos;s poverty .
Nelson Mandela said , in the mid-2000s , not too far from here , he said that like slavery and Apartheid , &quot; Poverty is not natural .
It &apos;s man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot;
I want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing , I think , extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
Thank you very much for your time .

Didier Sornette : How we can predict the next financial crisis
The 2007-2008 financial crisis , you might think , was an unpredictable one-time crash . But Didier Sornette and his Financial Crisis Observatory have plotted a set of early warning signs for unstable , growing systems , tracking the moment when any bubble is about to pop .
